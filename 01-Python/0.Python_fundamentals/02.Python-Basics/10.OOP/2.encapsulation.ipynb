    "Encapsulation is one of the fundamental concepts of object-oriented programming (OOP). It describes the idea of data encapsulation and the methods that work with data within a unit. It limits direct access to variables and methods and can prevent accidental modification of data. To prevent accidental modification, the variable of an object can only be modified by the method of an object. \n",
