Type of challenge: **learning** </br>
Duration: **2 days** </br>
Team challenge: **solo**

## The Mission

You might not be aware of it, but when you type instructions (_commands_) at your prompt you're actually speaking in a **shell language** (_on Linux it's usually Bash_). The good thing is that this kind of language can simplify your life and allow you to **automate processes** by simply dumping a set of instructions into a file (_script_) and executing it when needed.

In other words, so far you have used the **command line** directly from the prompt, but did you know you could send instructions to your **shell** via a file? Well, you can and it's called a **script**, let's check it out!

Go through each one of the exercises below to learn **bash scripting** !

> **NOTE**: Shell scripting language are especially good at processing data (input, output) and system administration, but it should be complemented with other languages (C, Python, Ruby, etc...) for other kinds of tasks.

## Final Words

Scripting allows you to automate tasks you would otherwise have had to perform manually. Channel your inner coach potato and make your life easier !
