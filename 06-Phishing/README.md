# Phishing Basics

Phishing is a scamming technique on the Internet that involves tricking the user into believing they are communicating with a legitimate company (such as a bank, an online shopping site, or a social network) when in reality, they are providing their personal information (such as passwords, credit card numbers, or login credentials) to fraudsters.

Fraudsters often use emails or text messages to send links that lead to websites that closely resemble legitimate sites but are actually imitations created to steal sensitive information. They may also use phone calls or direct messages on social media to trap users.

It is important to be wary of emails, messages, or calls that ask for personal or financial information, especially if they come from an unknown or suspicious source. Users should also be aware that websites can be falsified to look legitimate and should carefully check the web address, security certificates, and contact details before providing sensitive information.

**Some examples :**
1. The 2019 phishing attack against employees of Facebook and Google: Hackers sent phishing emails that appeared to come from colleagues, inviting employees to open files containing malware. The hackers were then able to access the accounts and data of the employees.
2. The 2020 phishing attack against the US government: State-sponsored hackers sent phishing emails that appeared to come from government services, inviting recipients to click on a link to obtain information about the coronavirus. The links then redirected users to phishing sites that stole their login information.
3. The 2021 phishing attack against Microsoft 365 users: Hackers sent phishing emails that appeared to come from Microsoft, inviting users to click on a link to verify their account. The links then redirected users to phishing sites that stole their login credentials.

**Here are some measures you can take to detect phishing emails:**

1. Security awareness training: Offer regular training to all staff in your organization to raise awareness of the risks of phishing and inform them of best practices for identifying suspicious emails.
2. Malicious link analysis: Check links in emails to detect malicious URLs. You can use email security tools to analyze links and see if they point to known or suspected phishing sites.
3. Sender verification: Carefully check the email address of the sender and make sure it matches the claimed company or organization. Fraudsters may use similar domain names to trick users.
4. Malicious attachment detection: Check attachments for malicious files, such as Microsoft Office documents with malicious macros or PDF files with malicious scripts.
5. Use of advanced security technologies: Use advanced security technologies, such as behavioral analysis and machine learning, to detect sophisticated phishing emails that may evade traditional security measures.
