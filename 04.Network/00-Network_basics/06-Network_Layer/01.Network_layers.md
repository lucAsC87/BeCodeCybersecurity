# Network layers

## IP protocol

The network layer manipulates packets and takes care of :

* **The address of the end devices** allowing them to be located on the network
* **Encapsulation** of [PDU data](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protocol_Data_Unit) from the previous layer with information such as source and destination IP addresses
* **Routing** to direct the information in the right direction on the network
* **De-encapsulation** of a packet arriving on the network machine

The IP protocol is a connectionless protocol (which does not make a connection with the destination before sending the packet), does not allow to follow the packets and thus does not allow to manage the good delivery of this one. And finally, it is independent of the medium on which it is used but adapts the size of its packets according to it. The IP header does not contain much information except the IP addresses of the source and destination.

### IPv4 headers

The headers of an IPv4 packet are the following:

* **version** (4 Bits) The version of IP used (in this case `0100`)
* **Different service** (8 Bits) Gives priority to certain packets
* **Time-To-Live (TTL)** (8 Bits) Allows you to limit the lifetime of a packet; as soon as a packet is processed by a router, it decreases by 1
* **Protocol** (8 Bits) The protocol used by the previous layer
* **Source IP address** The IP address of the machine sending the packet
The IP address of the machine to which the packet is destined 
* **Destination IP address** The IP address of the machine to which the packet is destined

> Example of protocols :  
    - *ICMP* 1  
    - *TCP* 2  
    - *UDP* 17

### Limitations

Today, the IPv4 protocol faces several limitations. First of all, the available IP addresses will run out due to the increase in the number of connected devices. The routing tables of the network routers are filling up more and more and this causes an increase in the resources needed. To avoid exposing an entire network, the NAT system is implemented and prevents having a public IP address from end to end.

## IPv6
To solve the problems of IPv4, IPv6 was created allowing an address space of 128 bits instead of 32, which allows the creation of 340 Unidecilions of addresses. More efficient processing of packets and the uselessness of the NAT system due to the large number of IP addresses.

Compared to IPv4, the headers have been modified to simplify them. Thus we keep the version field, the source address field and the destination address but we modify the position of some and we delete others. Thus, the IPv6 protocol offers:

* A simplified header format
* More useful data
* A hierarchical network architecture
* Automatic address configuration
* No need for NAT (Magic)

### Headers

* **Version** (4 bits)
* **Traffic class** (8 bits) Allows you to prioritize the packet
* **Flow label** (20 bits) allows you to specify that all packets with the same flow label should be processed in the same way
* **Length of payload** (16 bits)
* **Next header** (8 bits) Indicates the type of data carried by the packet
* **Hop limit** (8 bits) represents the TTL
* **Source address**
* **Destination address**

## Routing

To communicate, a machine can send data to itself through a loopback address; to a local host on the same network as it or to a remote host through the default gateway.

The default gateway is the machine that routes traffic to a remote network, it has an IP address on both networks and can transmit data from one to the other.

![](https://static.tp-link.com/res/upfile/faq/20160506093615.png)

Each host on the network has a routing table on each of its interfaces to conclude whether the packet to be sent is on the local network or not.

The routing table of a router allows to associate a network to an interface. This network can be discovered automatically or configured manually.

In the case of a local network directly connected to an interface, a line in the routing table consists of the letter `C` when automatically discovered or `L` when manually configured. Followed by the IP address and the mask of the network concerned and finally the interface on which this network is associated.

A routing line of a remote network is composed of the following elements in order:
* **The method used to discover the network** this may be `S` for a static route, `D` for Enhaced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol, or an `O` for Open Shortest Path First.
* **Destination Network** The network to which packets can be routed
* **Administrative distance** A number to check the reliability of a route, the lower the number the more reliable the route
* **Metric** A value to give a value to reach the network, a low value is preferred
* **Next leg** The address to the local network at the router to reach the specified network
* **Route timestamp** to specify when the route was last maintained
* **Exit interface** The interface to send the packet to for this route

## Routers

Routers are just computers composed of an operating system (IOS), a processor, RAM and ROM.

* **The RAM** is used to store information quickly
* **The read-only memory** contains data that can not be modified (except by Cisco of course)
* **Non-volatile RAM** used as permanent storage for the `startup-config` configuration file
* **Flash memory** Non-volatile memory containing the system and log files
* **Advanced integration module** used to offload the processor from time consuming actions such as cryptography

At boot time, the system contained in the flash memory is loaded into the RAM as well as the global configuration file. The boot process is as follows

1. **Execution of POST tests and loading of the startup program** a technical and power diagnosis of the router followed by loading the system into RAM
2. **Loading of IOS**.
3. **Locating and loading the configuration file** 


> THE good fact : To see the current version of cisco IOS you must type the command `show version`.

## Router configuration

We won't go back to the basic configuration of the device here because it has already been seen in [chapter 2](../02-IOS/01.Configuration_ios.md).

The configuration of an interface goes through several commands executed from the global configuration.

```
# Enter the interface configuration mode
interface gigabitethernet 0/0
# We configure the network of the interface
ip address 192.168.10.1 255.255.255.0
# Configure the default gateway
ip default-gateway 192.168.10.50
# Give a description for the interface
description Link to LAN-10
# (Re)start the interface
no shutdown
```
You can then check its configuration with one of the commands

* `show ip interface brief` Displays an overview of the interfaces
* `show ip route` Displays the routing table
* `show interfaces` Show interface statistics
* `show ip interface` Displays IPv4 statistics for interfaces
