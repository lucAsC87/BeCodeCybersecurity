# IP Addressing and Subnetting
- Repository: ip_addressing_and_subnetting
- Type of Challenge: learning
- Duration: 3 days
- Team challenge : solo

## Preamble
Subnetting divides broadcast domains, meaning that traffic is routed efficiently, improving speed and network performance.
A subnet mask ensures that traffic remains within its designated subnet. This reduces major congestion and reduces the load imparted on the network. With sub-networks, less distance needs to be traveled by data packets, enhancing network performance.
With different subnets within your larger network, you can be more aware of route maps. These will help you to identify potential threats. With subnets, devices will not be able to access the whole network, meaning that companies can dictate which hardware and users have access to more sensitive data. Network security can be boosted.
Sound organization is crucial within large businesses. This extends to your newtork and routers. With subnetting, companies have full control over their traffic and data packets.

## The Mission
As a future Network/Security/CloudOps/DevSecOps Engineer, you have found your dream job, you have successfully passed the first interview with the HR person responsible for the recruitment process, and in a few days you will have a second interview with the senior Network/Security/CloudOps/DevSecOps Engineer from that compagny. During the first interview, you have been warned that for you to maximize your chances to pass the second interview, it's crutial to master the key concepts behind IPv4 Addressing classes and Network Subnetting, and you have been given this [document](./assets/Ip-addressing-and-subnetting-workbook.pdf) for you to prepare.

Your mission is to learn everyting that is mentioned in the Learning Objectives and make as much exercices as you can from that document. The more exerices you make, the more chances you will have to get the job !

## Learning Objectives :
Ny the end of this briefing you should be able to :
- Understand the basics about IPv4 and it's dot-decimal representation.
- Understand IPv4 Address Class Identification and reserved IPv4 ranges, and which IPv4 class belongs to which usage.
- Understand what a subnetmask is.
- Understand what a CIDR notation is.
- Perform a decimal to binary conversion (and vise versa).
- Know which part of the IP belongs to the Network and which part belongs to the Hosts (given an ip/cidr)
- Retrieve the Network ID given a ip/cidr.
- Retrieve the Broadcast ID given a ip/cidr.
- Retrieve the First Host IP given a ip/cidr.
- Retrieve the Last Host IP given a ip/cidr.
- Retrieve the Next Network given a ip/cidr.

## A final note of encouragement
My recommandation would be to watch all three NextGenT videos or the Practical Networking playlist above, then read the Cisco article, and finaly read the wikipedia articles (just for consolidation), then you should be ready to tackle the exercices.
<br />
Good Luck !
