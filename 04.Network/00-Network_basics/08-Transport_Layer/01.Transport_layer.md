# Transport layer

The transport layer is responsible for establishing a communication session between applications. The purpose of the transport layer is to follow the exchanges of applications on the network, to segment the data to be sent to correspond to the protocol of the Internet layer but also to identify the applications that can send and receive data by assigning a port number to each of them.

With the help of the headers assigned to each segment, the transport layer can reconstitute the data received in the right order despite a multiplexing of the signal to share the bandwidth.

There are two types of protocols used on the transport layer and present in the TCP/IP protocol suite

**TCP** is a reliable protocol because it traces each packet transmitted by a system of acknowledgement. It also numbers the segments allowing the reconstitution in the order of the data but also a retransmission of the missing data. This protocol is slower in transmission but allows a reliability of the data in domains where the quality of these is important like databases, web browsing or sending emails.

**UDP** is a protocol using a so-called "best effort" system, i.e. unreliable. This means that data is sent and no acknowledgement of receipt is requested, reducing the load required to transmit data but with the uncertainty of the quality of the received data. This protocol is used in areas where the speed of reception is more important than the quality of the data received, such as a continuous video or audio stream.

## Ports

Port management allows several applications to communicate on the same system. To do this we assign a port to each application to communicate. A **source** port and a **destination** port. With the IP address and the port, we have all the information to make two applications communicate on two different systems. There are different types of port numbers:

* **Reserved ports (0-1023)** allowing standard applications to communicate
* **Registered ports (1024-49151)** registered with the IANA by companies to standardize the ports used
* **Private or dynamic ports (49152-65535)** ports dynamically assigned by a host to allow two-way connectivity

> Quick tip: The `netstat` command allows to display the ports used on a machine

The same port cannot be used by two applications simultaneously and only packets requesting a connection on an open port are accepted.

## TCP

The TCP protocol aims to establish a connection that verifies connectivity between the sending and receiving host, guarantees delivery by means of reliable routing (acknowledgement), delivers data in the right order and finally controls the data flow so that it meets the requirements of the transmission medium.

To achieve this, the protocol includes the following headers:

* **Source and destination ports (32 bits)** to define the application to communicate with
* **Order number (32 Bits)** allowing the reorganization of the data
* **Acknowledgement number (32 Bits)** to indicate the receipt of data
* **Header length (4 bits)** The size of TCP headers
* **Reserved range (6 Bits)**
* **Control (6 Bits)** Indicating the purpose of the segment
* **Window size (16 bits)** The number of segments accepted at the same time
* **Checksum (16 bits)** used to check for segment errors
* **Urgent (16 bits)** indicates if a packet is urgent

To make a connection, 3 steps are required.

### Handshake
In the real world, a handshake is a common greeting between two people. Similarly, a computer handshake serves as a greeting between two computer systems. It is commonly used to initialize a network connection between two hosts.

A computer handshake can be completed between any two systems communicating with each other in the same way. protocol. The two systems can be a client and server or simply two computers on a P2P network. The handshake confirms the identity of the connecting systems and enables further communication.

Handshaking on a network is commonly called 3-Way Handshake or "SYN-SYN-ACK". A successful handshake consists of seven steps:

1. Host A (client) sends a synchronization (SYN) packet to host B.
2. Host B (server) receives the SYN request from Host A.
3. Host B (server) sends a synchronization acknowledgement (SYN-ACK) message to Host A.
4. Host A (client) receives the SYN-ACK message from Host B.
5. Host A (client) sends an acknowledgement message (ACK) to Host B.
6. Host B (server) receives the ACK message from Host A.
7. The connection between the two systems is established.

When a system initiates a handshake, there are three possible outcomes:

1. No response - If the system receiving the negotiation is not available or does not support the protocol used by the initiating system, it may not respond to the request.
2. Connection rejected - The system receiving the negotiation is available and understands the request, but rejects the connection.
3. Connection Accepted - The system receiving the negotiation is available, receives the request, and accepts the connection.

The third outcome mentioned above is the only one in which the handshake is completed. If a negotiation is successful, the two systems can begin to communicate and transfer (data) via the established protocol. 

To close a connection, proceed as follows:

1. The client sends an end request (FIN request)
2. The server acknowledges and sends an end segment (ACK and FIN request)
3. The client acknowledges the end segment (ACK request)


Each TCP connection has 3 steps:

1. We check that the destination device is present
2. We make sure that the destination device has an application on the defined port
3. We inform the device of the connection request

These connections are orchestrated by the control head which can take as values:

* **URG** Urgent packet
* **ACK** Acknowledgement of receipt
* **PSH** Push function
* **RST** Reset connection
* **SYN** Synchronize sequence numbers
* **FIN** No data from sender (end of connection)

To reconstitute the data in the right order, a number allowing to reorder them is concluded at the time of the connection, this initial number called ISN is a random number being used as a basis has all the connection.

To avoid acknowledging the reception of all the segments, a window size is set up as the maximum size of data that can be received by the server without needing an acknowledgement. Nothing prevents the server from acknowledging the receipt before.

The TCP protocol includes a network congestion management system to optimize transfers. Thus the client can reduce the number of bytes before the acknowledgement of receipt to fluidify the network.

> Examples: Applications using TCP  
> HTTP  
> FTP  
> SMTP  
> Telnet  

## UDP

The UDP protocol is much simpler because it is intended to be fast and must minimize the addition of data or the sending of superfluous segments. Thus the UDP header consists of only 8 bytes including :

* **Source and destination port (32 bits)**
* **Data length (16 bits)**
* **Control sum (16 bits)**

The UDP protocol, despite its simplicity, remains useful and more or less reliable. Indeed, if no response is received during a certain time, the packets sent at the beginning are resent.

The UDP protocol does not provide a system to reassemble the data, they are simply reassembled in the order in which they arrived. In this protocol the data is separated into **datagrams**. If the order is important to the application, it is up to the application to reorder them.

> Examples: Applications using UDP
> DHCP  
> DNS  
> SNMP  
> TFTP  
> VoIP  
> Television over IP
