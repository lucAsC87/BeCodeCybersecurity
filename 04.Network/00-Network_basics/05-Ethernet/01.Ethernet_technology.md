# Chapter 5: Ethernet Technology

Ethernet is the most widely used LAN technology today. It is positioned on the data link layer and supports bandwidths of 10, 100, 1,000, 10,000, 40,000 and 100,000 Mbps. This standard defines a Protocol of layer 2 and 3 and is divided into two sub-layers:

* **LLC** which manages the communication between the upper and lower layers. This layer is completely software and hardware independent. Moreover it is quite funny.
* **MAC** The lower sub-layer, it is implemented at the hardware level of the network cards of the machine.

Ethernet was created in 1973 and has constantly evolved to increase its bandwidth and become more flexible.

## MAC sub-layer

This sub-layer has two objectives, encapsulate data and control access to the medium.

This sub-layer in charge of encapsulation therefore manages : 

* **Frame delimitation** allowing the synchronization of the transmitter with the receiver
* **Physical addressing** of the frame
* **Error detection**

The sub-layer also manages the access to the medium and checks the availability of the medium and possible collisions.

The structure of an Ethernet frame is as follows

### Frame structure

The structure of the ethernet frame is as follows, its size can vary between 64 and 1,518 bytes and any frame outside these values will be considered a collision fragment.

> Fun fact: a frame of more than 1,500 bytes is considered a "Jumbo frame" or "Baby giant frame".

|Preamble|Destination address|Source address|Type|Data|Frame check|
|---------|----------------------|--------------|----|-------|----------------|
|8 bytes|6 bytes|6 bytes|2 bytes|46 to 1.500 bytes|4 bytes|

* **Preamble** Frame Delimiter (SFD) used to synchronize the sender with the receiver
* **Destination MAC address** The physical identifier of the recipient allowing unicast, multicast or broadcast
* **Source MAC address** The originating identifier of the frame
* **EtherType** A field identifying the protocol of the previous source
* **Data** The encapsulated data from the upper layer
* **Frame termination (FCS)** Used to detect frame errors and terminate the frame

> Example: Some types of protocols: 
> * 0x800 (IPv4)
> * 0x86DD (IPv6)
> * 0x806 (ARP)

### MAC address

Hexadecimal is the writing system for MAC addresses and IP addresses. It is presented as a system of numbers from 0 to 9 and from A to F whose equivalences are shown in the table below.

![Table d'equivalence hexadecimal](https://cryptlabs.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/1_PkHLh296lpvyEyJ2KPxdSw.png)

A MAC address is represented by grouping the hexadecimal characters in pairs and separating them with `-` or `:` or by grouping them by 4 and separating them with `.`.

> Example :
> 00-05-9A-3C-78-00
> 00:05:9A:3C:78:00
> 0005.9A3C.7800

A MAC address consists of two parts of 24 Bits, one defined by the IEEE and specific to each manufacturer and another left to the choice of the manufacturer. Thus, we are assured that a MAC address is unique worldwide. This system is called *OUI* for Organizationally Unique Identifier.


Most often the MAC address is burned into the read-only memory of the network card, so it is called non-volatile (BIA). However, it can be changed by software in the operating system. At startup, this non-volatile address is stored in the RAM for use.

When a packet reaches the network card, the network card compares the destination MAC address with the one stored in RAM and interprets the packet if it is the destination.

Switches use two types of methods to transfer frames to the associated port:

* **Cut-Through** routes the frame before it is completely read and does not check for errors; in the fast-forward variant, data is immediately transmitted and this can cause some problems but allows for high throughput; the second Fragment-free variant consists of storing the first 64 bits before concluding a port to communicate to and performing a small frame error check

* **Store and Forward** Stores the frame in memory and while the frame is being stored, the switch decides which port to forward the frame to and performs a cyclic redundancy test (CRC) by analyzing the frame tail to verify that the frame is valid so as not to clog the network with invalid data.

To allow a good transmission, the switches are provided with buffers that can be of two types:

* **Port-based** Frames are stored in queues associated with each inbound and outbound port; data is transmitted as soon as the port becomes available
* **Shared memory** A single memory holds all frames and the destination port is dynamically allocated

The ethernet protocol can work in half-duplex or full-duplex, when connecting to a switch or another device, the two devices exchange to choose the best way of transmission depending on the system offering the best bandwidth. If we don't agree we risk a lot of collisions on the channel coming from the half-duplex system.

Another point to agree on is the type of cable used. To avoid a configuration, we use the Auto-MDIX system which allows, by multiple exchanges between switch and other peripherals, to conclude the type of cable used and thus to modify the configurations accordingly.

## ARP

If the destination IP address does not belong to the current network, the machine automatically sends it to the gateway, a Layer 3 machine that connects to a remote network.

To associate an IP address with the MAC addresses along the path, the ARP protocol is used to resolve the MAC addresses and to keep a mapping table.

To resolve MAC addresses from the IP address of a device, it consults the mapping table contained in its RAM. If the corresponding MAC address is not present, it sends an ARP request on the network.

An ARP request contains in its body, either the target IP address or the target MAC address which must be completed. And the ethernet frame of this type of request contains in headers:

* **The broadcast MAC address** allowing everyone to respond
* **The source MAC address** of the sending machine
* **The frame type** which is 0x806 in the case of an ARP request

After this request only the machine corresponding to the IP given in the body answers with the IP address of the sender and its MAC address. And is accompanied by a standard ethnet unicast frame with the ARP type. As soon as the sending device receives the response it adds it to its mapping table and sends the expected frame.

Mapping table entries are quickly deleted if they are not used for some time but this depends on the operating system.

To display the mapping table you can use the `show ip arp` command on Cisco appliances or `arp -a` on Windows 7.

If many ARP requests are broadcast at the same time on a low bandwidth network it can flood the network, but this kind of performance loss is minimal.

Some hackers can impersonate another device by responding to certain ARP requests that are not intended for it and thus poison the device's mapping table.

## ARP Spoofing Attacks
The effects of ARP spoofing attacks can have serious implications for enterprises. In their most basic application, ARP spoofing attacks are used to steal sensitive information. Beyond this, ARP spoofing attacks are often used to facilitate other attacks such as:

* Denial-of-service attacks: DoS attacks often leverage ARP spoofing to link multiple IP addresses with a single target’s MAC address. As a result, traffic that is intended for many different IP addresses will be redirected to the target’s MAC address, overloading the target with traffic.
* Session hijacking: Session hijacking attacks can use ARP spoofing to steal session IDs, granting attackers access to private systems and data.
* Man-in-the-middle attacks: MITM attacks can rely on ARP spoofing to intercept and modify traffic between victims.
