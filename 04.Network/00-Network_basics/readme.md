## Objectives 
Introduction to the network and its components.

## Step 1 - (4 hours)
If you haven't already done so, register on try hack me and start the Pre Security course. You only have to do the exercises circled in red in the image below. These courses are free.

## Step 2 - Introduction to OSI model. ( 6 days )

Telecommunication is a technical consensus activity. This is why
thanks to the standardization of the CCITT (International Consultative Committee
Telegraphic Consultative Committee), that all the telephones of the world can
communicate.

Unfortunately, for the transmission of data, there is no
complete standardization. Linking computer systems is often difficult.

For this reason the I.S.O. (International Standards Organization) has developed a partial standardization, which is called open system, the O.S.I. model.
( Open Systems Interconnection ).

The OSI model proposes a way in which two elements of a network (workstation, server, etc... ) communicate, by decomposing the various operations to
be carried out in 7 successive steps, which are named the 7 LAYERS of the
OSI MODEL. This model only defines the service or the function, but not the way in which it must be how it should be performed.

Each layer communicates with the lower and higher layers through an interface
through an interface that allows the layers to be stacked together. 

Through these chapters, we will learn about each of these layers and discover their usefulness.

2. [IOS](./02-IOS/)
3. [Protocols](./03-Protocols/)
4. [Network access](./04-Network_access/)
5. [Ethernet](./05-Ethernet/)
6. [Network layer](./06-Network_Layer/)
7. [Ip addressing and subnetting](./07-Ip_addressing_and_subnetting/)
8. [Transport layer](./08-Transport_Layer/)
9. [Application layer](./09-Application_layer/)
