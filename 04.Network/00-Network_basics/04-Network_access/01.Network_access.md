# Chapter 4: Network Access

## Physical layer
The physical layer is responsible for the actual transmission of electrical, radio frequency or optical signals between the parties.
Its service is generally limited to the transmission and reception of a bit or a continuous bit stream (especially for synchronous media such as optical fiber).

There are 3 elementary forms of physical supports:

* **Copper cable** The signals are electrical impulses
* **Fiber optic cable** Signals are variations of light
* **Wireless** Signals are variations of microwave transmission

All these aspects are managed by the following standardization bodies: 

* ISO (International standards organization)
* TIA/EIA (Telecomunication industry association/Electronic industries association)
* IUT (International Telecommunication Union)
* ANSI (American National standards institute)
* IEEE (Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers)
* Other governmental authorities such as the FCC or ETSI
* Local organizations such as JSA/JIS, CENELEC or CSA 

This physical layer covers 3 main functions:

* The physical components in charge of transmitting the signal such as Ethernet ports, cables or other systems
* The coding to convert the data stream into a sequence of variations understandable by both ends of the transmission channel
* The signaling method to represent a 1 or a 0 in the transmission channel

### Bandwidth & Throughput


The bandwidth is the capacity of the medium to transport data. It is measured by the amount of data that can be transmitted over a certain period of time. It is most often expressed in KBit/s, e, MBit/s or GBit/s.

This bandwidth can vary depending on the properties of the physical medium and the technologies chosen to signal or detect the signals.

Throughput is a measure of the amount of data exchanged during a certain period of time. This throughput often does not reach the estimated bandwidth because it varies according to :

* The quality of the traffic
* The type of traffic
* The latency created by the number of devices on the network, i.e. the time it takes for data to travel from one end to the other.

The *Application Rate* measures the usable throughput and excludes the traffic overload of the network by connection establishment or acknowledgements.

## Copper

The copper support represents a cheap system of communication but presents a problem: the disturbances. Indeed, an electric current can be disturbed in many ways but here are the two main ones:

* Electromagnetic interference (EMI) and radio frequency interference (RFI) ** These interferences produced by external agents can modify the signal; this phenomenon can be countered by shielding the network cables. 
* Crosstalk** A phenomenon in which two cables interfere with each other; this phenomenon can be countered by twisting the cables.

It is then logical that the longer a cable is the more it is subject to disturbances, it is therefore necessary to restrict the length of these.

There are 3 main copper supports:

* **UTP (Unshielded Twisted Pair)** The most common type of cable terminated by an RJ-45 connection; it consists of 4 pairs of wires surrounded by a sheath
* **STP (Shielded Twisted Pairs)** More expensive, it has in addition to the properties of UTP, a metal mesh that, properly grounded, can counteract external interference.
* **Coaxial** tends to be replaced by twisted pair cables, they are presented by a conductor cable and a shield separated by a sheath; they are still used in wireless connection or internet cable

The copper cables present security risks in terms of fire due to the weak protection of those but also electrical in the case of a malfunction or lightning, sending a strong current to the cable.

### UTP

UTP cables do not have any protection against external disturbances, so the following solutions are used: 

* **Cancellation** By coupling the wires that have an inverse magnetic field, we can cancel their disturbances and those from the outside.
* **Number of twists** To avoid any problem, we vary the number of twists per pair of wires on each pair of the cable.

The cables are divided into categories allowing a greater or lesser flow

|Categories|rate|
|---------|-----|
|3|<100 MBit/s|
|5|100 MBit/s|
|5e and 6|1000 MBit/s|
|6e|10 GBit/s|

![SchÃ©mas des cables UTP](https://4.imimg.com/data4/CV/GS/MY-16570674/cat-3-cable-500x500.jpg)

UTP cables are often terminated with RJ-45 connectors which must be of good quality to allow good performance.

In order to perfectly meet the expectations, we must directly choose the cables according to their internal organization, so we have :

* **Straight ethernet cable** The most used cable and has the same configuration on both sides; it is used to connect a host to a network device; there are then two T568A connectors
* **Crossover Ethernet Cable** Less used and has reversed cables on both sides; It is used to connect two similar devices; It has two connectors, one on each side
* **Reverse cable** Reserved for Cisco, it allows communication between the serial port of a machine and the console port of a router.

### Fiber Optics

Optical fiber is a pure and transparent wire the size of a human hair. The data is coded by light pulses. Fiber optics are used to connect network devices because it allows very high data rates that it is the only one able to support.

Fiber optic technology is currently used in :

* Enterprise networks
* FTTH (Fiber to the home) technology
* Long distance networks
* Underwater networks

The fiber optic consists of :

* A **core** transmitting the light
* A **cladding** functioning as a mirror reflecting the light from the heart
* A **coating** protecting the heart
* A **strenght member** to prevent the fiber from stretching
* A **Outer jack** protecting the whole

![Representation d'une fibre optique](https://denisetian.files.wordpress.com/2018/08/cc3a2ble-fibre-optique.jpg)

The signals are sent into a fiber optic cable by means of an LED or a laser. But fiber optic cables are classified into two types:

* **Single mode fiber** The core is reduced and the base is used to transmit the data, the light passes straight through the core and thus prevents dispersion; it is used for long distance transport (100 km minimum) because this technology is expensive
* **(MMF) Multimode fiber** The core is wider and uses an LED to send the signal; the light is reflected on the envelope and allows a less expensive transmission but a more important dispersion; it offers a rate of 10 GBit/s on 550 meters maximum

Optical fibers use specific types of connectors:

* **ST** One of the first connectors produced, it connects with a twist lock
* **SC** A square shaped connector that snaps on to check the connection
* **LC** A smaller version of the SC connector
* **LC bidirectional** Has two connectors for bidirectional connection

In any case, an optical fiber is monodirectional, so it is required to connect two fibers.

Fiber optics is chosen for installations requiring high traffic, such as enterprise entry points, but a copper network is preferred for dispersing individual network accesses because fiber technology is still expensive and difficult to maintain.


### Wireless

Wireless is a rapidly expanding network due to new devices and new uses. On the other hand, wireless communication imposes a restricted coverage area, more present interferences, less important security and a support shared by multiple devices that can be overloaded.

The wireless imposes that the bits are coded on a radio signal and implies specific material to transmit and receive this type of connection.

We will deal here with the short or medium range wireless standards: 

* **WiFi** WLAN technology based on CSMA/CA protocol; the network card first listens before transmitting to avoid collision
* **Bluetooth** A personal area network (SAN) technology using a pairing protocol and allowing communication over a maximum of 100m
* **WiMax** A wireless technology that uses a point-to-multipoint topology to provide network access

Implementing a wireless LAN requires the installation of certain systems such as a wireless access point and a wireless card on each host. The equipment must be chosen carefully or else the equipment may be incompatible.

## Data Link Layer

The Data Link Layer must:

* Accept and encapsulate Layer 3 packets
* Prepare data for physical transmission
* Exchange frames between nodes
* Receive and de-encapsulate packets for higher layers
* Detecting errors

The layer is divided into two sub-layers:


* **The LLC (Logical Link Control) layer** places the information in the final frame and indicates the protocol used for transmission
* **Media Access Layer (MAC)** defines the processes for accessing network media and manages the different technologies.

The Layer 2 frame is changed as the frame leaves a specific network through a router. It is also possible that the protocols used for transmission are not IP but the data remains the same. Thus, the layer 2 frame is renewed at each network section it crosses. As soon as a frame arrives on a Layer 3 device, it de-encapsulates the Layer 2 frame and then re-encapsulates it according to the protocol used to transmit the data on the next leg.

The IEE, the ITU, the ISO and the ANSI standardize the layer 2 frames.

## Topologies

To access the network, the MAC sub-layer (network access) sets up rules allowing everyone to send and receive data without colliding. These rules depend on the topology of the network and the system of sharing the physical medium.

The topology of a network is its organization of the devices it contains. We can differentiate two representations:

* **Physical topology** showing the physical relations of the devices between them by cables
* **Logical topology** showing the relations between the nodes of the network and the path through which they communicate. We then represent virtual connections between the nodes of the network.


### WAN Topologies

* **Point to point** The simplest topology composed of a permanent connection between two points; the system does not have to check that the host is well connected, the transmission protocol can be very simple

* **Hub and Spoke** The WAN version of the star LAN topology. A central point connects to a number of peripheral points.
![](https://ptgmedia.pearsoncmg.com/images/chap1_9781587134326/elementLinks/01fig03_alt.jpg)
* **Mesh** A topology allowing high availability but implying that each of the points is connected to the

### LAN Topologies
Here are the most common topologies: 

* **Star** Each end device is connected to a central intermediate device; this topology is easy to set up and evolve and is therefore widely used
* **Fully connected** In an extended system, the intermediate devices are connected to each other and each is a central point of a star system
**Bus** A topology where all devices are connected to each other in a chain that terminates at end caps; switches are not needed here; bus topology was widely used a few years ago for its ease of installation and use
* **RING** Each host is connected to its neighbor, which forms a ring and thus does not need to be terminated; this topology is used in FDDI (Fiber Distributed Data Interface) and Token Ring networks.

There are other topologies, you can even combine them.

## Frame

The data link layer encapsulates the data previously encapsulated by the other layers in a frame composed of headers, data and a tail. All the protocols of this layer follow this system, only the size of these elements differs depending on the environment. Indeed, the more information is likely to be lost, the more information is needed to reconstitute it and thus the larger the headers and the lower the throughput.

The encapsulation of data by layer 2 is called *frame locking*. This frame contains various information as shown in the following figure.

* **Start and end indication** They allow to identify the start and the end of the frame. As long as the end is not reached, the receiver waits for other data.
* **Addressing** The source and destination nodes
* **Type** The Layer 3 Protocol used in the data
* **Control** An area provided to check the quality of network service and used to prioritize certain messages
* **Error Detection** A field used to verify that no errors have occurred

Frames differ according to the Layer 2 protocol used, depending on the location of the network and its extent. Thus we can find :

* Ethernet
* 802.11 wireless
* PPP (Point-To-Point protocol)
* HDLC
* FrameRelay
