# Network exploration

## Connected to the whole world
Today, fast and efficient communication is very important in our society. Its evolution has been fast and great things are still to come allowing to abolish the geographical borders.

There are all types of networks, whether human or computer. The networks are then useful to share and operate at the personal scale but also at the scale of the company.

Today, the computer network is used for multiple purposes, and is therefore called a converged network.

## Clients and servers
All computers and machines using the network are hosts (also called end devices). Servers are software programs that provide their services. Clients are software programs that request information from servers for use by the user.

> Example : An http server is a host that has software and provides a service based on the http protocol. It is this service that allows a website to be hosted and made accessible to the whole world. We can for example quote [apache](https://httpd.apache.org/), [nginx](https://www.nginx.com/) which are very used.


Clients are software programs that request information from servers so that the user can use them.

> Example: A Web server allows to put at disposal on the network, web pages obtained via HTTP. Firefox or Google Chrome are clients that will contact the server to obtain the requested page.

### Peer to peer
It can happen that a host holds both the role of client and server, so each host can receive and transmit information. This network is called a peer to peer network.

> Example: If you use [Utorrent](https://www.utorrent.com/), you are both the client when you download (legal stuff of course :) ), but you are also the server side with your previously downloaded torrents that become accessible to other users.

**Benefits :**

* Easy to configure
* Less complexity
* Lower cost
* Can be used for simple tasks like file transfer


**Disadvantages :**

* No centralized administration
* Little security
* Not scalable
* Slow performance.

## Network components
The structure of a network is composed of 3 main parts:

* The devices
* Physical Connections
* The services

### The devices
The machines that receive and send data. These can be machines hosting servers or clients.

> Examples: Computer, IP Phone, Printer.

###  Physical Connections
The physical components are the network topology and network connecting devices, which include network interface cards (NIC), cabling, connections, and all other hardware to connect the computers.


#### Switch 
What is a network switch?
To understand the basics of networking, you must first answer the question "What is a network switch?"

Most corporate networks today use switches to connect computers, printers and servers in an office building. A switch acts as a controller, allowing networked devices to communicate efficiently. Through information sharing and resource allocation, switches save businesses money and increase employee productivity.

Here are the different types of Ethernet switches and their features.

**Unmanaged switches**
An unmanaged switch is right out of the box. Since it is not designed to be configured, you don't have to worry about installing or implementing it properly. Unmanaged switches have less network capacity than managed switches. You'll typically find unmanaged switches in a home network equipment.

**Managed Switches**
A managed network switch is configurable, offering greater flexibility and capacity than an unmanaged switch. You can monitor and adapt a managed switch locally or remotely to better control the network.


#### Router
What is a network switch versus a router?
Switches create a network. Routers connect networks. A router connects computers to the Internet, so users can share the connection. A router acts as a dispatcher, choosing the best path for information to be transmitted for fast reception.


#### Cabling
The cable can be of 3 different types:

* Metal wire (copper) the data is in the form of electricity
* Glass or plastic fiber (optical fiber) data is in the form of light
* Wireless: data is coded according to an electromagnetic wavelength

We choose the type of support to use according to :

* The maximum distance over which the media can carry the signal
* The environment in which the media is installed
* The amount of data to be transported
* The cost of the installation

## Network types

The network structures can vary depending on :

* The size of the area covered
* The number of users
* The services available

Among the main infrastructures we find : 

* **LAN (Local Area Network)** A network that is not very geographically extensive, usually a small business or home network. This network allows for high bandwidth.
* **WAN (Wide Area Network)** A larger network geographically managed by a network provider.

* **MAN (Metropolitan Area Network)**  A network of larger size geographically managed by a network provider.

* **WLAN (Wireless LAN) ou réseau sans fil** A network similar to a LAN but wireless

* **SAN (Storage Area Network** A network for transmitting and backing up files

### Internet

The Internet is a set of WANs that interconnect a large part of the planet. The Internet is not owned by one person but each of the networks participates.

### Intranet & extranet

The term intranet refers to a small network owned by a company or organization.

Extranet is a network service provided by a company or organization to allow interaction with it from outside its LAN or MAN network.

### Internet access

The access to the internet can be done by several supports: 

* **DSL**  The telephone network with DSL technology is used to transmit data

* **Cable**  Direct connection to the network through a specific cable
* **Cellular**  Uses a wireless telephone signal to communicate on the network
* **Satellite** Connects to the network via a satellite, which is more useful in remote areas
* **Ligne commutée** A low speed connection 

##  Network architectures

The networks allowing today to connect all the types of media that they are intended for the broadcast, the telephone or the transmission of data must be :

* Fault-tolerant: The network must always be available despite the failure of one of its components
* Scalable: Allowing for rapid expansion to accommodate new devices
* Qualitative: Allowing to optimize transfers to obtain the highest possible throughput
* Secure: Allowing to keep the confidentiality, integrity and availability of exchanges

##  Expansion of uses

Today, we notice an increase in the daily use of the Internet in many new ways:  : 

* **BYOD (Bring Your Own Device)**  The user is allowed to use the end device he wants to connect to the network
* **Online collaboration**
* **Video communication**
* **Cloud computing** Allowing to store a mass of data on the internet without the need to mobilize one's own team or equipment.

We also use new ways to connect end devices: 

* **Powerline** Home power cables are used to transmit data
* **Wireless broadband** Using cellular technology


## Security

The security of a network is paramount and systems must be in place to prevent all external threats:

* **Viruses, worms and Trojans** Software that executes malicious code on the user device
* **Spyware or Adware** Software that collects data from the user's system
* **Zero day** Attacks on the day the vulnerability is detected
* **Hacker attack** Attacks performed by someone with strong network knowledge
* **Data theft**
* **Identity theft**

There is no master solution to secure a network but a set of solutions can be put in place:

* Installing anti-virus and anti-spyware software
* Install a firewall to filter data entering and leaving the network
* Specify the access of each person to the network resources
* Virtual private networks allowing secure access outside the LAN
