# Mac Address

MAC address (Short for Media Access Control) is assigned at the factory to a network device such as NIC. MAC address is protocol independent. Layer 2 devices such as switches, and bridges use MAC address to distinguish between different nodes in a network segment.

## Mac Address Format

A MAC address on a network is a 12-digit hexadecimal number (total 48 bits) in the format:

``MM-MM-MM-SS-SS-SS``

The first half of a MAC address contains the ID number assigned to the adapter manufacturer.

The second half of a MAC address is the serial number assigned to the adapter by the manufacturer.

You can find the MAC address on your computer by typing "ipconfig /all" at the command prompt of a Windows OS computer.

In the figure above, the value D8-BB-C1-54-C9-CF represents the MAC address of the host named "system". Whichever higher layer protocol you use, the MAC address remains the same. In the MAC address given, D8-BB-C1 is NIC manufacturer ID, and 54-C9-CF is the serial number given to the adapter by the manufacturer.

MAC addresses are assigned by card manufacturers when they are built.
