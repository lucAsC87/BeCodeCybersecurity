# Chapter 2: Configuring a Network Operating System
IOS (short for Internetwork Operating System) is the operating system for the network. 

Every machine requires an operating system to function, including network machines. IOS (short for Internetwork Operating System) is the operating system found on network machines such as routers and switches. We will see here the Cisco IOS network operating systems but the idea is the same for any network machine builder.

## Operating system

The operating system is the link between the user and the hardware. It is composed of an interface that can be graphical (based on windows) or command line (text interpreter). And a kernel that makes the link between the interface and the hardware.

## IOS

### Access

To access the IOS system, several methods can be used, each with its advantages and disadvantages.

* **Console** A physical management port of a system that can be accessed outside the network and useful for device maintenance, it uses a specific cable
* **SSH (secure shell)** allowing to connect to the system remotely
* **Telnet** Unsecured access method, all passwords and commands are transmitted in clear text
* **AUX** Old port using a telephone connection and a modem to be administered

### Command modes

There are two main command modes allowing the user to do more or less actions.

* **User mode** visible through the `>` prompt, allows limited monitoring actions but prevents any configuration changes.
* **Privileged mode** visible through the `#` prompt, allows to perform maintenance and configuration operations on the router. This mode is entered with the `enable` command from user mode.
* **Configuration mode** visible through the `(config)#` prompt and accessible through the privileged mode, where you can modify the device configuration. You enter this mode with the `configure terminal` command
* **Line configuration mode** visible through the `(config-line)#` command and accessible through the configuration mode, it allows to modify the configuration of console access, ssh or telnet. You enter this mode with the `line` command
* **Interface configuration mode** visible through the prompt `(config-if)#` and accessible from the configuration mode, it allows to modify the configuration related to network interfaces. You enter this mode with the `interface` command

### Command structure

An IOS command consists of several elements:

![Prompt> commande arguments](https://mybecode-files-production.s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/f53cba3b-3e2a-4c1f-8d50-352889d2c1bf-commande.png)

IOS implements help features that can be accessed by the command `?` at any time. Also entering an incorrect syntax will be informed in the guest.

### Device name

The device name is used to recognize a device on the network. This name must :

* Begin with a letter
* Not contain spaces
* End with a letter or a number
* Not contain letters, numbers or dashes
* Be less than 64 characters long

To configure the device name (hostname), in the configuration mode, use the command `hostname` followed by the new device name.

> Example :
> ```
> Switch# configure terminal
> Switch(config)# hostname SW-Floor-1
> SW-Floor-1(config)#
> ```

You can undo the changes by using `no hostname`.

### Security

IOS systems allow the following actions to secure the hardware: 

* Add a password to the privileged execution mode
* Add a password to the user mode
* Add a password for remote access
* Encrypt passwords
* Add a legal notice

#### Passwords 

A password is added when accessing the provileged execution mode with the command `enable secret` followed by the password. This command must be executed in the global configuration mode.

A password is added to the user access with the command `password` followed by the password. This command must be executed in the online configuration mode (`line console 0`). Then activate authentication with the command `login` (it can be deactivated with `no login`).

The same can be done for remote access via telnet or ssh using the same commands as above but in vty configuration mode (`line vty 0 15`).

The passwords are then written in clear text in the startup-config and running-config files which can be a security problem. To enable password encryption one can use the command `service password-encryption` in the global configuration mode.

#### Legal message

To prevent the private aspect of the material we can set up a banner that will be displayed at each connection. To do this we use the command `banner word #<message>#`. Then we write the message between the `#`.

### Configuration files

There are two configuration files on the IOS system:

* **startup-config** The configuration in RAM and non-volatile memory which allows it to be retained despite system shutdown.
* **running-config** A copy of startup-config used by the system. This configuration is reset when the machine is rebooted.

To display one of the two configurations you use the `show` command followed by the name of the configuration to be displayed.

To save the current configuration in memory and thus persist this configuration we use the command `copy running-config startup-config`.

If an unwanted configuration is added we can use the `reload` command to reload the device and return to the startup-config. In the worst case we can delete the initial configuration with `erase startup-config`. This will reset the configuration to its original state on the next reload.

## IP Address

An IP address is the main tool that allows devices to locate each other. An IP address is composed of 4 numbers from 0 to 255 separated by dots.

An IP address can be assigned to each physical port and to virtual interfaces of Cisco devices.

### Interface

An interface is the junction between the machine's hardware and the network medium. An interface is often represented as a physical Ethernet port because it is the most common LAn protocol, but there are many other types of ports that depend on :

* The distance over which the medium can transmit information
* The environment in which the media is installed
* The throughput
* The cost of installation

#### Virtual Interface

A virtual interface (called SVI) is, in Cisco Layer 3 systems and above, a means of remotely managing the switch and has an IP address. The default virtual interface is Vlan1

To configure a virtual interface, you must enter the interface configuration mode by giving the name of the interface. By default the virtual interface is `vlan1` so we enter this mode with `interface vlan 1` from the privileged execution mode. We can then configure its IP address using the command `ip address <ip address> <mask>`. We must then restart the interface with the command `no shutdown`.

> Example
> ```
> Switch(config)# interface vlan 1
> Switch(config-if)# ip address 192.168.10.2 255.255.255.0
> Switch(config-if)# no shutdown
> ```


### IP Configuration

The configuration of the IP address can be done manually by specifying the address and the mask in the system settings.

But it can also be done automatically by following the DHCP protocol allowing to ask a specialized server for an IP address and a mask.

### Tests and monitoring

On a Cisco machine, you can run various commands to test or monitor interfaces.

To display the IP of an interface you would use `show ip interface brief` from the privileged execution mode. This command displays the status of the machine's interfaces and various information about it

To test the connection from one machine to another, use the `ping` command to request a response from the remote machine.
