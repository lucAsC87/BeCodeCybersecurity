 # Chapter 3: Protocols and network communication

## Structure of a communication

Any communication can be represented by 5 main elements and the communication between computers is no exception: 

* The source of the message to be emitted (The source machine)
* The transmitter of the signal (the source network card)
* The transmission medium (copper, air or optical fiber)
* Receiver of the message (destination network card)
* The receiver of the message (destination machine)

To communicate properly, the machines must agree on a shared language to communicate. This is called *protocol*. There are many protocols that are standardized to allow a correct communication. This protocol defines the information that the source machine must provide to be understood by the network.

To correctly transmit the message, the machines use not only one Protocol but a series of Protocols adding each one of them new information allowing to transmit the message. We call this organization the *suite of protocols*. Thus the message to be sent is encapsulated by each of the protocols allowing its transmission.

### coding

For transmission purposes, the data to be sent must undergo a transformation to make them compatible with the transmission medium and the protocol used. This operation is called *coding*.

> Example: In a telephone conversation, each received sound is coded in the form of bit then sent to the recipient who reconstitutes the sound starting from the received information.

### Encapsulation

The raw message, even coded, can not be sent as is on the network, it must provide other information such as the recipient of the letter or the sender. This information is added at the beginning or at the end of the message to be sent. The encapsulation consists then in adding information to the raw message according to the information required by the network. The whole encapsulated message is called *frame* and can be sent on the network. There can be several phases of encapsulation of a message.

For example in the case of an HTTP frame we find the content of the page to display in the user data then a sequence of encapsulation add information to the frame allowing to specify its destination, the version of the protocols used, and many other things.

### Size
To respect the protocol used for the transmission, the message can be divided into several frames so as not to clog the network.

### Synchronization and frame management

When two hosts send a frame at the same time on the network, a *collision* occurs. To avoid this, the protocol must define an access method defining when the hosts should talk and what to do in case of an error.

To avoid clogging the network, the Protocol must also specify a *flow control* system to give each host a chance to send data over the network.

Finally, the Protocol must also define a *waiting time*, which when exceeded, will allow the sending host without a response to consider that no response has been given.

### Sending method

The sending of a frame can be done in 3 different ways:

* **Unicast** The frame is sent to a single host
* **Multicast** Send the frame to a group of hosts
* **Broadcast** Send the frame to all the hosts of the network

Each frame can ask for an acknowledgement of receipt or not.

## Network protocol

The protocols that govern networks are protocols that are defined, precise and accepted by all the machines that use them. There are many protocols and these protocols are organized in *suites of protocols* allowing a good communication.

A protocol can be :

* Open** It is then standardized by a standardization organization and can be used everywhere and by all
* Proprietary** It is then standardized by the company which created it and can be used only by this same company.

There are many protocol suites but here are some examples

![Quelques piles de protocoles](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/a6/f7/db/a6f7dbbf7d58bdb7d62e129a7d013836.jpg)

The TCP/IP protocol suite today consists of many of the protocols shown in the following figure.

![Suite de protocoles TCP/IP](https://mybecode-files-production.s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/be289e91-00ef-4985-92fb-e098c13350fc-tcp-protocol-suit.png)

Protocols are stacked in layers. To use an application protocol, one needs to use one or more protocols per layer below and to perform encapsulation.

### Application protocols

* **DNS** For Domain Name System, allows to translate domain names into IP addresses
* **BOOTP** Predecessor of DHCP, it allows a machine to know its IP on the network
* **DHCP** For Dynamic Host Configuration, dynamically assigns IP addresses to clients and allows reuse of unused IP addresses.
* **SMTP** For Simple Mail Transfer Protocol, allows clients to send an email to a mail server and the server to send this email to other servers
* **POP** For Post Office Protocol, allows to retrieve emails from a mail server, these emails are downloaded from the server to the desktop
* **IMAP** For Internet Message Access Protocol, allows you to access emails from a mail server and store them remotely
* **FTP** For File Transfer Protocol, defines the rules that allow the user of a host to access files on another host on the network and transfer files to that remote host
* **TFTP** For Trivial file transfer protocol, allows simple file transfers without connection and without acknowledgement of receipt
* **HTTP** For Hypertext Transfer Protocol, allows you to transfer media, text and graphics over the web.

### Transport protocols

**UDP** For User Datagram Protocol, allows to transfer packets from one host to another without acknowledgement.
**TCP** For Transmission Control Protocol, allows reliable communication between the processes of two remote hosts with acknowledgement of receipt

### Internet Protocols

* **IP** For Internet Protocol, used to group messages into packets and indicate the destination address
* **NAT** Convert local addresses into global addresses on the world network
* **ICMP** For Internet Control Message Protocol, allows to signal to the remote host the errors occurred during the transmission
* **OSPF** For Open Shortest Path First, allows to route packets in the right direction by a hierarchical design of the zones
* **EIGRP** For Enhaces Interior Gateway Routing Protocol, a Cisco proprietary protocol allowing to give an appropriate metric according to the bandwidth

### Network Access Protocols

* **ARP** For Address Resolution Protocol, provides a dynamic mapping between an IP address and a physical address
* **PPP** Piont-to-point Protocol, allows packets to be encapsulated for transmission over a serial connection
* **Ethernet** The most widely used local protocol for defining cabling and signaling rules
* **Interface drivers** Give instructions to the computer to communicate with its network interfaces

## Open standards

Having an open standard allows to:

* Promote interoperability of products
* Prevent the monopoly of a product

An open standard is managed by a standardization body which is, most often, a non-profit association that is not linked to any manufacturer

### Internet Standards Organizations

* **ISOC** For Internet Society, in charge of promoting an open Internet
* **IETF** Internet Engineering Task Force, a working group in charge of developing, updating and maintaining Internet standards.
* **IETF** Internet Engineering Task Force, a working group in charge of developing, updating and managing Internet and TCP/IP technologies through standardization documents like RFCs
* **IRTF** Internet Research Task Force, a long-term research group on the Internet and TCP/IP in the areas of cryptography, anti-spam and peer-to-peer
* **ICANN** Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers, an association that coordinates the allocation of IP addresses and the management of domain names
* **IANA** For Internet Assigned Numbers Authority, an authority that oversees IP addresses and protocols used by ICANN

### Electronic standards and communications organizations

* **IEEE** For Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers
* **EIA** For Electronic Industries Alliance, a trade alliance for cable and rack communications standards
* **TIA** For Telecommunications Industry Association, an association responsible for communications standards in many areas
* **ITU-T** stands for International Telecommunication Union Telecommunication Standardization Sector, one of the oldest standardization bodies that defines video compression standards.


## Layered model

We now represent our network in successive layers following 2 models:

* **Protocol model** This model follows a sequence of defined protocols, this function is provided by the TCP/IP model
* **Referring model** Ensures a general coherence of each operation to be carried out in each layer, this model is provided by the OSI model


![](http://ekladata.com/aeBuslVMq4DsHC_mmQsxlzTQTsw.jpg)

### OSI model

The OSI model consists of 7 successive layers: 

* **7. Application** Contains protocols used for process-to-process communications
* **6. Presentation** Provides a common representation of data transferred between application layer services
* **5. Session** Provides services to the presentation layer to organize its dialogue and manage data exchange
* **4. Transport** Defines services to segment, transfer and reassemble individual communication data between end devices
* **3. network** Provides services to exchange individual data parts over the network between identified end devices
* **2. Data Link** Data Link describes methods of exchanging data frames between devices over a common medium
* **1. Physical** Describes the mechanical, electrical, functional and methodological means to enable, manage and disable physical connections for the transmission of bits to and from a network device.

### TCP/IP model

Composed of only 4 layers defined by the protocols used:

* **4. Application** User data and dialog controls
* **3. Transport** Supports communication between multiple devices across the network
* **2. Internet** Determines the best network path
* **1. network access** Controls the hardware devices and media that make up the network


## Data transfer

The data to be transferred cannot be sent all at once because it would cause data problems. Two systems must be taken into account to optimize the data flow and to give the possibility to all to communicate

### Segmentation

To reduce the amount of data to be transmitted, we divide the data into several different frames.

### Multiplexing

To give each host a chance to communicate, we interleave the data from each host, allowing us to mix the packets transmitted.

### Frame transformation

When an application sends data, the data passes through the protocol stack that encapsulates the data and ends up on the communication channel.

1. The data is constituted to be sent
2. Data is divided into segments
3. Segments are encapsulated according to the protocol stack
4. Packets are formed to be sent over the network
5. The bits of the frame are sent on the physical medium


### Desencapsulation

During the reception of the frame, the data are decapsulated in the opposite direction of the encapsulation.

### Network addresses

To communicate, you need a couple of addresses.

* **Source address** where the data comes from
* **Destination address** where the data goes to

Each layer has its own transmission method but addresses are only used in the network layer and the data link layer.

* **Data link layer** (MAC address) The address is used for the transfer from card to card on the same network. Thus the frame of this layer changes as soon as it is transferred on a different network through a router.

* **Network layer** (IP address) The address is used from the source to the destination even if they are not on the same network it is composed of a network part and a host part
