## Pentesting steps

* Pre-engagement : This is surely the phase that many novices will neglect/forget, wrongly, because it is during this phase that we will define the scope of the test and the methods that will be used for it.

* Reconnaissance : Collecting as much publically accessible informations about the target as possible.

* Enumeration/Scanning : Discover the applications and services running on the systems, scan the ports (it's time for nmap).

* **Exploitation :** Exploit vulnerabilities discovered on a system or application either via public exploits or via exploitation of the application/system logic.

* Privilege Escalation : Once you have successfully exploited a system or application, a foothold in the jargon, you need to extend your access to the system. We talk about horizontal and vertical escalation, horizontal escalation corresponds to a transition to another user with the same permissions, vertical escalation corresponds to access to admin permissions.

* Post-exploitation : This phase is broken down into several sub-steps:

    - Full privilege collection : Additional information with a high-privileged user.

    - Pivoting : Check of other potential targets.

    - Clean-up : Erase the traces of your intrusion.

    - Reporting : Report harvesters, the flaws that have been discovered, the methods used, the paths, the tools, the commands, or any other relevant information that can be used in the last phase.

    - Remediation : Fixing and proposing solutions for all vulnerabilities that were identified during the reporting phase.
